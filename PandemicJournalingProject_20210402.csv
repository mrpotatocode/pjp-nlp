1,journal-entry-12333," It's still the pandemic, although the Chauvin trial is a close second.

 The pandemic surge is happening, AGAIN. I despair for America and the rest of the world. I have friends and family in Europe, where they are again in lockdown. I hear news reports of vaccine refusers (even health care workers) in Africa. Vaccine supply is spotty at best in the rest of the world, and those in rural, underdeveloped countries are at the mercy of their governments. This is a virus that keeps mutating. I suspect it will be the main news story for years."
2,journal-entry-12329," I found out I was pregnant ( a surprise) in July. The appointments were different being fully masked and my husband wasn’t allowed to come along. When in September we realized this pregnancy was difficult and would be filled with specialists, that proved even more difficult by having to go it alone. My husband joined me on most appointments by speaker phone or FaceTime, but as we all know from pandemic times- it’s not the same. He missed seeing the baby on an ultrasound, I missed having him hold my hand during the amniocentesis. Then when we learned the pregnancy wasn’t viable, and covid precautions prohibit a nurse from hugging you, the specialist from holding a hand, from your husband to be by your side...it adds so much to the grief and the anger.

 In addition to all those difficulties- due to the pandemic no one knew. No moms at school drop off noticed my growing belly, because there was no school drop off. My daughters didn’t truly understand the situation because due to covid so much was a mystery- they couldn’t join me at appointments, etc.

 So much was taken from us in those 5 months of pregnancy- all our hopes and dreams that came with a new baby, and all the support and love we needed from community because our community was isolated from us. We couldn’t go to a counselor together as a family, we couldn’t go to our house of worship to pray, to mourn to grieve our child. So much of the pregnancy feels like a dream- because of the isolation surrounding it."
3,journal-entry-1909,"Bueno, me he dado cuenta que  me he vuelto un poco más irritable, tengo poca paciencia , y eso es algo que siempre es necesario con un bebé.

Pero las descargas de esa irritación las hago con mi esposo, y eso me preocupa, no logro establecer rutinas de sueño con mi bebé, es más estas dos últimas noches se ha dormido re tarde, y es extenuante, a veces me siento mala madre, sumado a todas las miradas y críticas que siento o que me dicen, no tenemos un momento y lugar para desfogarnos por el no poder salir.

 Sinceramente deseo con todo mi corazón que esto termine, el miedo más el cansancio y la rabia son muy difíciles de manejar, trato de acostumbrarme a todo esto pero no lo logro, me pongo a pensar que mi hija no se va a dar cuenta que es la normalidad o al menos la que nosotros conocíamos, ella ya tiene su visor y cuando nos toca salir saluda a todo el mundo, me da mucha pena no poder llevarla a jugar con otros niños, niñas, siento que es algo injusto con ella porque es hermosa y muy sociable y no lo puede expresar como quisiera.

 Quisiera llorar pero no puedo, no estoy sola, y odio llorar frente a otras personas."
4,journal-entry-1628," Antes de la pandemia, eramos otras personas.

Antes de la pandemia, llevábamos vidas muy apresuradas, disminuíamos la importancia a ciertos temas como: la salud mental, la convivencia en familia, la higiene, entre otros.

La pandemia ha cambiado mi vida drásticamente, y no solo la mía, la de millones de personas tambien.

 Quiero pensar que el presente en el que vivo, me ha hecho favores para mi futuro. 

Soy una persona que sufre de ansiedad generalizada, desde hace mas de 3 años, antes no le prestaba importancia, pero ahora si.

Creí que esta normalidad seria temporal, nada de muchos meses, pero me equivoque. Con el paso de las semanas empece a tener estragos de la ansiedad, cada dia eran mas frecuentes y dañaban mas mi estabilidad emocional y social.

Pero lastimosamente, no fue la única cosa negativa que me sucedió en este tiempo.

La distancia y el amor no siempre van de la mano, creo que es una regla de oro que todos saben. Asi que, si paso, rompí con mi pareja, con la persona que creí pasar el resto de mi vida a mi lado. Creo que estuvo bien, pues la cuarentena solo anticipo lo que pasaría en el futuro ¿no?

Y por ultimo, probablemente fracase en mi examen de admisión de la universidad.

Mi examen de admisión fue en lineal, estaba muy emocionada por presentarlo, ya que, ir a la universidad siempre ha sido una de mis metas mas importantes. Sin embargo, el dia del examen todo fue un caos, se cayo la plataforma donde se presenta el examen y un millón de problemas técnicos mas.

 Me gustaria poder decir que la cuarentena ha sido buena conmigo, pero sucedieron cosas negativas que tuvieron un impacto innegable.

Aun asi, este tiempo intento convertirlo en algo positivo para mi interior, dejar las malas manías mentales de juzgarme y ser tan dura conmigo misma.

Nadie despues de este presente volverá a hacer el mismo."
5,journal-entry-12110,"Only twice in the past year has any stranger approached me with my permission at all: getting my flu shot and getting my first dose of covid vaccine, both of which happened in the car.

Occasionally people come too close to me in passing, especially frightening inside my apartment building. But only those 2 strangers with needles have come near enough to touch me.

 I feel like all strangers are terrifying and I don't want to be anywhere near them."
6,journal-entry-12147,"Sitting on quite a lot of anger and something else, a feeling of betrayal, and that ""moral injury"" often talked about these plague days. A friend wrote me, blithely asking, ""so I'm volunteering to distribute food. Am I agriculture? Or food service worker?"" And as we are both Kaiser members and live in California, I knew immediately that she was referencing the questionnaire that Kaiser sends to determine eligibility according to prioritized groups for the vaccine, which is still not in abundant supply right now in CA, and still not getting equitably to groups like agricultural workers in the Central Valley, and food service workers in restaurants. In the Bay Area, poverty is an emergency now. People live in their cars and deliver for Doordash. And this woman who is not rich, but comfortable, asks me, for what...? Permission? To assuage her nagging sense that she is lying?

In response, I said, I would be careful about misrepresenting that. She replied, ""not misrepresenting. I'm volunteering."" This does not make you a food service or ag worker, I answered. And then, there was a little silence between us. Until a few days ago, when she wrote me, ""call now! CA will be vaccinating everyone over 50 starting April 1st."" So I got on hold to Kaiser, and  during the time I was on hold, remembered my overdue glaucoma appointment, something I don't want to do unvaccinated, because...moral injury again...the medical assistants in that department let their masks hang under their noses. And I ask the advice nurse about this, and she says, in her judgement, I have a chronic condition, and should be vaccinated, and I say, I don't want to skip the line, and she assures me I am not.

So I write my friend to tell her I am getting vaccinated, and she expresses indignation that I am cutting the line, when I'd made it so clear that I cared so deeply about that.

 And so, we are not friends now, and she is one of a handful of folk who have fallen away from me during this time. Glaucoma as metaphor: the pandemic is like the glasses I got after my diagnosis; I noticed one part of the lens was sharper, just this one lower right part of one side of a pair of glasses. My sight is sharper, changed, in the presence of these people, who gossip about lying for the shot, who cheat, who denied or minimized the danger, so they could have this wedding, or that Thanksgiving feast. I can't look away. A lot of times it's my own self I can't stand the sight of, as inward-gazing is also a nasty pastime of this past year. But the friendships, they are fewer, and I'm still deciding if that makes me lonelier."
7,journal-entry-12093," The pandemic doesn't feel real anymore. That doesn't mean my life is ""back to normal;"" I do not go to restaurants or shops, I always wear a mask when getting groceries, and I do not see friends and family indoors/unmasked. But it's just how life is now. It no longer feels like a surreal event. Life still feels like an exhausting slog, though."
8,journal-entry-3263," Pensamos que los casos estaban disminuyendo, pero de un día para otro regresaron 33 pruebas indicando positivos, fue un golpe duro para todos, temen volver una etapa atrás y que eso signifique tener que cerrar negocios y detener otros empleos.

Yo vivo en zona rural, aunque se tiene consideración por el hecho de que los productores deben abastecer de sus productos igual al mercado, el número de empleados se han reducido para evitar contagios, sin mencionar que se reducen también los días de trabajo. Yo por ejemplo la semana pasada solo trabajé dos días de 12, así se están haciendo las cosas por ahora, muchas horas de trabajo en pocos días y a toda velocidad para evitar tener que volver hasta nuevo aviso.

Es mucha exigencia física, por ser tantas horas decorridas, el frío, estando de pie y dónde te recuerdan cada hora que todo debe hacerse con las mayores exigencias para poder seguir enviando la fruta o las hortalizas; pero peor sería no trabajar. Todo dinero viene bien aunque sea poco y la exigencia mucha."
9,journal-entry-1651," Uno cree que a cierta edad somos inmunes a los virus , que solo afectan a las personas mayores, con su sistema inmunológico débil, con alguna enfermedad como la diabetes, cancer, vih, con obesidad o hipertensión. El caso es que  sentimos que jamás nos va a tocar, hasta que una persona cercana a la familia fallece. O tus primas se contagian y aunque no convivas con ellas porque viven en otro estado, sabes que en cualquier momento puede tocarte.  Yo me considero una persona débil, psicológica y anímicamente, mi alimentación es pésima, solo como dos veces al día y aún así considero que tengo sobrepeso. Una vez dije que si a mi me pasaba, de una gripe o fiebre no iba a pasar ¿pero adivinen que? Hace una semana que estoy consciente de que tengo coronavirus y es la peor sensación del universo el estar consciente de que tus pulmones pueden fallar y tu cabeza te da ideas de que tu o tu madre pueden fallecer en cualquier momento.  Mi mamá dio positivo hace unos días, aunque su primer prueba rápida fue hace dos sábados y dio negativo, el martes se hizo la oficial y el viernes dio positivo. Supongamos que se contagio entre sábado y lunes, llevamos más de una semana. Gracias al estrés y la pésima alimentación que yo llevo, el tomar duchas a las 4 am por el calor, o el dormirme a las 5 am, la fiebre que me dio el martes pasado se la atribuí a todo lo anterior. Aunque el virus da los primeros síntomas en los primeros dos o 15 días. Hagamos las cuentas, presenté síntomas sin saberlo y mi vida era bastante normal hasta el viernes pasado que llegaron los resultados de mi mamá y sentí que todo en mi se hundió. Mi mamá tiene diabetes, no grave, es bastante saludable desde hace un año que lo supo.  El domingo falleció un amigo cercano con el que convivíamos casi todos los días, venía a almorzar a la casa porque ya no estaba trabajando, me traía pan, comida y jugos, el mundo de mi mamá se derrumbó el domingo pasado y el mío quedó con cierto hueco que será difícil de llenar. El martes estuvimos bien por el día hasta que a mi mamá se le comenzó a dificultar el tragar saliva y yo comencé a entrar en pánico y a llorar ¿que sería de mi, sin mi madre? Ya perdí a mi abuela hace cinco años y lo que vino después me dejó en una terrible depresión, bajé de peso porque no comía, sufría ataques de pánico y ansiedad todo el tiempo, supe salir de eso gracias a la iglesia, porque honestamente Dios es lo único que nos puede ayudar a mantener la fe.  El día de ayer comencé a llorar en los brazos de mi madre porque tengo mucho miedo, mi pecho dolía y no podía respirar  ¿que es lo primero que se te viene a la mente en estos momentos? ¿Que los pulmones pueden colapsar, que vas a dejar de respirar y todo eso? Pues si. Entré en pánico y estaba consciente de que mi mente es más poderosa que yo y que todo me da miedo. Mi mamá no tiene ningún síntoma y estoy agradecida por eso. Y luego estoy yo que comencé con tos y con infección en la garganta ¡en tiempos de covid! Estoy alarmada. Mis amigos cercanos parecen ignorarlo y echarme sermones de gente que se cree muy inteligente cuando uno solo necesita apoyo moral para poder salir de esto. Otros solo mandan cosas para alarmarte y que te de un ataque de ansiedad más en el día ¿si ya tuviste tres desde que te despertaste, que importa otro? Pero también hay amigos que están al pendiente de mi y mi madre, mi mejor amiga me dijo que me cooperaba para un libro donde hablara sobre la ansiedad, me manda audios dándome aliento, me pregunta como estamos, si necesitamos algo. Al igual que mi vecina, que se ofrece a hacernos el mandado, las amigas de mi mamá que le vienen a dejar algo de comer, se ofrecen a hacer los pagos, o la familia que sigue buscando algo para ayudarnos, hay que rodearnos de gente positiva y comenzar a alejarse de la negatividad de las personas que te dicen que “las cosas pasan y no puedes hacer nada” o “ayer me contaron historias de personas que fallecieron por esto”.  En estos momentos estoy tranquila y esperando a que pase la segunda semana donde es la definitiva y ansío volver a salir a pasear con mi madre."
10,journal-entry-12172, Welcome to the fourth wave. Further evidence of apathy and stupidity. More suffering and death caused by people who don't care about anyone but themselves. We are trapped in their madness.
11,journal-entry-12142,"Last week was big! I got my 2nd Pfizer vaccine! Now I can plan outings with more friends. I'm still sticking with more outdoor dining while I wait and see if an uptick happens. We are so close now, let's not blow it folks!!"
12,journal-entry-12152,"I lived alone before the pandemic, and still do.

During the pandemic, especially the early months last spring, I tended to hoard groceries and toiletries, spending hours online to get the best deals on Amazon or Walmart.com, usually. I'm vegetarian, so I stocked up on things like shelf-stable almond milk, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, chocolate, cereal and grains in case it got too risky to go to the store.

I did such a good job that now my challenge is to use these products up as some have already passed their expiration or ""best by"" dates. Don't worry, I haven't gotten sick yet.

If you remember the toilet paper shortages we had last year. Well, I read somewhere online about someone who had purchased a large set of cheap, white hotel-style wash cloths and was using them, along with a ""portable bidet,"" in place of TP. I latched onto this idea and the practice has stuck with me, although I have stopped using the bidet, which seemed a little tedious and unnecessary, since I'm only using the washcloths for #1.

For a while I spent a whole lot of time cutting the wash cloths in half as they are way more cloth than I need for one use. I realized, though, after washing them, that they would begin to fray and unravel rather quickly if I didn't create a seam on the cut edge and sew them, which I did, by hand, since I don't have a sewing machine. I think I sewed about 20 halves and have another 30 whole cloths, but I've given up on that project. Too time-consuming.

 Being environmentally conscious, I like the idea of reusing/washing wash cloths instead of contributing to the felling of more trees. I bought white so I could bleach the heck out of them. So the TP is on still on hand for those other times when it's not #1, but I am still significantly reducing my use of TP. I also acquired a (free) wicker hamper on my Buy Nothing group which is solely to hold the used cloths (inside a plastic trash bag) until I can do a laundry load. I live alone, so there's no one to object to my admittedly quirky hygiene practices.

I still can see the empty paper products shelves at the grocery store, and the prospect of scrambling to grab a 6-pack or two does not appeal. Even though the shortage as passed, as far as I know, I'll stick with the wash cloth routine."
13,journal-entry-12153," Anger. Anger and fear.

People are going around without masks. They are gathering in large groups. They are doing everything possible to make the pandemic worse, not better. It angers me, it angers me beyond words that there are people who will selfishly threaten my life. And it frightens me: just when it seemed like we were making progress, it's getting worse again."
14,journal-entry-4338," Tuvimos un susto bastante grande, tuve que salirme temprano del trabajo por unas fuertes náuseas, terminé vomitando y tiritando de frío en mi cama a pleno mediodía un día del 28 °C de calor. Durante la tarde mi estómago había mejorado un poco, no mucho pero al menos ya no vomitaba, pero el problema vino cuando me tomé la fiebre. Fueron una horas dónde mi mente dolía y tenía frío y calor al mismo tiempo, era difícil estar acostada para mí.

 Ante la duda le avisé a mis allegados con los que compartí un contacto estrecho durante el día y el día anterior. Por suerte, al día siguiente bajó y no regresó.

Sospecho que habrá sido un poco de intoxicación, no lo sé.  Por suerte los días siguientes no tuve que trabajar y no presenté síntomas de nada, aún así me mantuve en mi casa lo más posible."
15,journal-entry-12008,"I see the true colors of people.

 In my religious community we talk about ""being Christlike."" Which means putting yourself third after God, and your neighbors. So many people who, I thought, were examples of Christlike behavior really weren't. They were putting on a show.

A year ago, this deadly virus showed up. By the end of April, the doctors and the smart people at the CDC and the WHO had learned that masks could potentially save lives.

 Many of those people who I thought of as example of being Christlike and who I aspiring to be like started screaming about their ""rights"" being violated. They started openly defying requests, pleadings, and finally orders to wear masks in public.

No amount of explaining that masks protect others would get through to them.

I began to realize that these people, with all their scriptural and gospel knowledge. These people with their professions of love for God and their spiritual brothers and sisters are really full of shit.

 This pandemic has not shaken my faith in God or in Christ, but has very much opened my eyes to the selfish imperfections of us all and especially those who I had looked up to as ""the spiritual example."""
16,journal-entry-12007,"My wife and I were able to get our first dose of the Moderna vaccine, and we are so grateful that we were able to do this.

Our 24 year old daughter who is living with us while in college also had her first dose.

The other two kids in the house have their appointments made for later in April, thanks to the state opening up availability to everyone over 16 years old.

There seems to be a light at the end of this very dark tunnel.

I'm still judging people and this is bothering me.

I see people without masks and it ticks me off.

 I went back into the office, even though I'm not sure that I was ready. There is a loose mask mandate in the office, but I see people, especially the partners walking around without masks and even though I've known these people for decades and know them to be good and generous people, I can't help thinking that they are, kind of, being jerks about the safety of their employees.

I have a couple of coworkers in my department who, because they have been vaccinated won't wear a mask. ""Well, I'm immune."" one of them told me. He doesn't understand that there is a possibility that he could still get it, and even though his symptoms would probably be mild, he could get someone else sick. The scientists just don't know yet, and until we do we need to protect each other.

 There are still jerks in the world, and it makes me sad."
17,journal-entry-1793," En el inicio de la pandemia, lo único en que me enfocaba era adaptarme a las nuevas normas que nos establecían a partir de ese momento. 

Ahora, aún sigo intentando adaptarme tanto como hija, estudiante y futura profesionista de la salud mental.

No solo me encargo de mi propia estabilidad emocional sino también de mis padres y personas que de vez en cuando requieren de cierto apoyo para enfrentar las situaciones difíciles.

 Mi semanas son como una montaña rusa emocional, puedo ser la mujer más feliz del mundo en la cima para bajar de nuevo a la cruda realidad que debo enfrentar.

Y, aún así, intento todos los días continuar y reflexionar sobre esto."

19,journal-entry-3264," Mis sueños siempre fueron bastante ""interesantes"", mi mamá les dice raros. 

Pero una de las cosas más recurrentes últimamente es soñar con mi antigua casa, en 2007 me mudé con mi mamá a dónde estoy ahora, eso ya es mucho tiempo, pero aún  así mis sueños transcurren en la casita vieja , estoy en su cocina con mi familia tal cual haríamos aquí, o me encuentro tomando un baño; en ese baño que siempre me molestó su ventana a la oscuridad del un rincón que había entre la casa y un pequeño galpón con cosas guardadas, recuerdo poner un toalla cubriendo el cristal para evitar sentirme observada por la negrura.

Soñé que el sillón que tenemos en esta casa ahora estaba allá y una amiga pidió quedarse con nosotros para evitar el contacto estrecho con sus hijas.  Todo, en la antigua casita. Ahí pasé mi niñez y la primera parte de mi adolescencia.

 Estaba ubicado atrás de la casa de mi abuela materna. Abuela que perdí un año después de la mudanza,  algunas veces sueño con ella, se ve feliz, otras veces me mira como... ¿Preocupada? Me recuerda a su cara de cuando éramos niños y no podíamos hacer nada ante el eminente corte de la luz o el agua por falta de pago. Era una expresión algo así como ""no me agrada, pero como no podemos hacer nada ya está, no importa, sigamos no se preocupen hay cosas peores"" "
20,journal-entry-11980,"Lately, I've been reminded of home more and more. I was not able to go home to Senegal during the quarantine last summer, so I haven't been home for two years now. Last week there were instances where I was reminded of that fact, be it because of something I saw on TV or through a conversation with a friend. I often think about what it is about home that I miss, and although I really miss the food, I've come to understand that I miss two things the most: Firstly,  my family, because of the comfort and love at home. Secondly, I miss the adhan (Islamic call to prayer) because of the security and peace of living in a Muslim nation surrounded by my brothers and sisters in faith."
21,journal-entry-11953," In November 2020, I did something new - I voted for Joe Biden for President. To be clear, I had never intended to vote for him. Raised by Republican parents, as time progressed, I moved predominately to the center. In the 2016 election, I voted independent and fully intended to repeat that in 2020. But the days before the election, I grew overwhelmingly disgusted with both political parties.

If you had mentioned any of the following words - ""Supreme Court replacement, Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump, fake news, mail in ballots, stimulus"" - it  triggered me. I started January incredibly interested in the political process but ended October just relieved that it was nearly over.

Overall, I felt that the coronavirus reinforced my belief that politicians don't care about the common man or woman. For example, last year, they forced all these businesses to close but had no plan on how to compensate those businesses. We allowed politicians to determine what businesses qualified as ""essential"" and that irked me. I don't like government overreaching and deciding what businesses can be open or not open. I also couldn't understand how we could only pass one stimulus plan before December 2020. Although I was not personally affected, my heart went out to all the people I know in the service industry who couldn't find another job.

I guess, the coronavirus made me more disgusted than ever with the political process.  Despite that, when it came time to vote, I decided that I would rather return to the status quo than continue on our current trajectory. I felt that although I have benefited financially during the pandemic, I was okay with paying more in taxes to help others who have been less fortunate."
22,journal-entry-11945,"One year later give and take, and things are opening up. Each friend or family who gets a shot is a sign of hope, like the crocus in the dead leaves. Yesterday I ate in public with the family in the city (outside, sunny sidewalk away from passerbys). It was disconcerting but also felt so good to be out and see so many people. It was after an errand, signing papers in a lawyer's hallway, windows open to the spring, the lawyer's dog occupying the kids. We refinanced houses with low rates, courtesy of pandemic.

 I find myself feeling loss for what I might have done differently this past year, personal development wise. But then I hear myself say that we survived it, both physically and in so many other ways. And many others didn't. Isn't that enough? And what will I miss of this time? I don't want to race ahead. But I don't want to delay the opening for so many who need it more than me.

Lots of questions: Will I be more lonely when this is over?

Is it possible I am more religious now with church closed?

What is next?"
23,journal-entry-11684," I watch my friends and family in other countries going out. They go to the store. They go to each other's homes. They go on airplanes.

 I am jealous and I am scared.

I am also thinking that this will be my second passover through all of this. In some ways it is calmer. No one around me is hording food or toilet paper. Shops are not about to be closed. Shelves are full.

But at least here in the UK, it is still illegal for us to go to family for the seders. It is illegal for us to have guests for meals. It doesn't feel safe to walk into the major Kosher shops.

 My husband and I will be using Zoom again to be with his family. This time his father will be with his aunt and uncle, and we will Zoom in. In all other times I would never think about connecting with others virtually on a holiday - but it is the only way and it means a lot for my husband's father. So I am being more lenient with my observance. I guess this might be the only forum that I would feel comfortable saying that this is what I am doing AND I even feel comfortable doing it. It goes against all of my learning and religious background, but I can't imagine any other option.

Now back to cleaning for Passover and work."
24,journal-entry-11949," I'm still really bitter about not being able to get the vaccine. I've seen so many friends and now coworkers get the vaccine. I get that there are different rollout plans in different areas, so I might be eligible for a vaccine in one state but not here. I also have not waited around a grocery store or vaccination site. But, I'm so frustrated by how many people around me have gotten it just by chance or good circumstances. Many rightfully deserve it, but I go into the office and feel like I've paid my dues of social distancing and keeping to myself. Don't I deserve the added level of protection that other healthy 30-year-olds can get? I try to be happy for people posting online that they've gotten a vaccine. I do very much support everyone getting it, but I can't help the jealousy I get, feeling like I'm still so naked and susceptible to this virus that could mildly affect us or could kill us. I have a list of things I want to start doing once I get vaccinated and leave enough time for it to build up my immunity. I feel like I""m doing the smart, considerate thing by not rushing to go to the gym or all the different doctors appointments or go shopping or get a massage. But, all these other people can. I can, in theory, but I'm trying to minimize my risks. I just feel so left out and so many people's lives are ""returning to some semblance of normalcy"" but I don't feel like that veil or pandemic life is lifting for me yet and there's supposed to be a light at the end of the tunnel, but I have no justification it's there for me yet."
25,journal-entry-11957," Let me tell you about something I missed, but I didn't realize I missed. It's a warm day, and the hot sun is beating down onto you and the outside table. The chips you're eating have that special taste that only comes in the summer, when the bag is heated by the sun and they taste oilier than normal. You're back inside, and you open the windows to let the warm breeze in. The sun sets, and it's still warm and humid outside. Although the cool of night is slowly setting in, you stand outside to feel the moist, warm breeze lifting your entire being, surrounding you with a feeling of calm, gratefulness, and serenity.

I forgot about all of those feelings until a few days ago, when we had a heat spell. The wind was warm, the outside was hot, and in the evening I felt that cool yet warm post-sunset breeze blowing through my hair. It's like those memories were locked away, only to be brought out again by the changing of the seasons. I never realized how those feelings were put away or how much I missed those feelings until I actually felt the breeze and the heat on my body. Now that the heat had temporarily ceded in favor of cooler, more humid days, I'm getting memories of Easter and going Easter egg hunting."
1,journal-entry-11955," I feel disconnected from myself and the world around me. This evening feels almost exactly the same as yesterday. Time seems to be moving fast as soon as the sun goes down, and not in a figurative way, but literally. I don't feel like myself, and I don't feel good. I'm fine in the morning and I have a lot of motivation then, but somewhere in the afternoon I slip and fall into a weird state. I don't feel present, I have a tiny headache right now (probably from eating too much sugar) but I just don't feel right and I don't feel like me. I've become disconnected from my happiness, and being in classes where the material is mostly serious and there's not much room for jokes or laughter doesn't help."
2,journal-entry-11967," I actually prefer my work since the pandemic started. I am better able to concentrate on what I am doing when there are only a few other people in the office. I have my own work station and my own chair instead of always wondering where I will be sitting and frantically looking for a chair that is in good shape that someone else hasn't taken already. It is easier to talk to supervisors over the computer (a system they set up when most people chose to work at home). At work, I am not looking forward to getting back to normal."
3,journal-entry-11862, My husband is more ready to move on and get out in crowds. I am not so we have many disagreements. He says why did I bother getting the vaccine if I am going to be so hesitant.  I think we should still be cautious.
4,journal-entry-9479," I have harassed maskless people I encounter, sometimes I lose my temper and verbally assault them. I have been sheltering in place for just about a year. I go out once a day for a walk, usually at midnight when the back streets have quieted down and I can avoid most people. Sometimes I feel like the ghost of COVID haunting the empty streets. Sometimes if it's a warm sunny day (I live in West Hollywood, in California), I will take my walk.

I often see maskless, younger people. I try to disregard them but there are moments when a well of anger bursts up from deep inside and I yell at them. Sometimes I even wave my cane at them in a threatening way. I want to beat the shit out of them. Then I remember I am 69 years old and that I need to calm down and go back home or someone will beat the shit out of me.

 Where is all this anger coming from? Likely because I have so many comorbidities -Yikes, I hate that word- I have to stay inside all day and have everything delivered. Likely because two of my best friends have died of Covid, one in Miami, a Trumper, who on his deathbed insisted that there is no such disease and that Covid is a conspiracy between the lamestream press and the democrats. His name was M., an intimate lifelong friend I have known since I was a teenager.

At home, the anger passes. I lift weights, I work on the book I am writing, watch Netflix and cook good food...waiting for the vaccine. - P., West Hollywood, California"
5,journal-entry-10700," We became inseparable in an AP world history class my junior year of high school. We were so enthusiastic and happy together, our teacher acknowledged us as his favorite students on the last day of school that year. We had known each other since we were in sixth grade, both students in a children's choir at a local conservatory, but we didn't become friends until that class. I felt like I could be 100% organically myself with her. I could be loud and weird, and instead of judging me, she would join me. We were referred to as the two old lady friends, and frankly we both thought that we would eventually become that. She and I both shared a similar broken household. On the surface, we both repressed it, but on a deeper level we didn't handle it the same. Being sent home for the remainder of the semester seemed like hell for the both of us. She also doesn't like texting. I worked on myself while at home. I shut my door and worked on both my mental and physical health, and emerged with a different attitude towards life. She remained radio silent on my end. Towards the end of April, we both knew that we had gotten into our top school, and for us, our top school was the same. When I read the text that she didn't want me to go to this school, it felt as if a part of me died. My person, the human whom I loved and shared so many happy memories with, didn't want me to go to the same school as her, even though she knew that it was also my top school. I tried to rationalize it, but it still burned my soul. Later on she apologized and we talked about it, but a part of me knew that the scar would always be there. She still doesn't text as much and I miss my friend. I know that she was reacting in such a way due to her environment, as I was also familiar with the hate and pain caused by my environment, often deflecting it towards myself, but even so, it felt like a break up. Anyways, I miss her and I hope that we can soon be old ladies making CVS runs and eating ice cream in her car again soon."

Mostly it is just a holding pattern - waiting for my turn to be vaccinated. Waiting to find out when my office will open up. Waiting to find out when it will be safe to take my mask off in the drive-through.

 I have not been sleeping well the past couple of weeks."
7,journal-entry-11864,"Yes and no. My relationship with my SO is fine. We've had a few bumps in the road, which is to be expected when you're in quarrantine with one other person. I also feel closer to family and friends, most of whom I haven't seen in well over a year.

 My biggest worry is that as an artist, I feel unable to create anything. When the lockdown began I had visions of unlimited time to try new art media and learn new skills. That didn't happen. I am really worried that my creativity may never return. It's a terrifying thought."
8,journal-entry-11867," I have worried about a few people that I know for whom the pandemic has rendered  without food and in danger of homelessness. By making donations of the government stimulus checks I have helped a couple of people. At times as a single mother I have been short on spending money, but I’ve never personally been without food or a home. I hope that more people come out of this wanting to recover from debt and with the control to actually start emergency funding for their families. My philosophy has always been to save first and then spend what is left. In that way there is always a little nest egg for the chance of disaster like this. I don’t know what is recommended today, but I’ve always thought that there should be enough in savings to live without income for a few months. I wish that people would see security in their own solvency even if the savings are only five bucks out of each pay check."

They are usually joggers....the can easily go around but they come straight at us and it’s infuriating. Sometimes I feel like yelling at them but I never do. All this pent up anger builds up and builds up and I have no release. We are very isolated because we want to protect our baby and taking quick walks around my neighborhood is one of the only outings we get. I just want this nightmare to be over already. I wish I could go to bed one night and just wake up to a pandemic-free world. I fear that will never happen. I fear this is a new reality and my baby never had the chance to experience the “old” pandemic free world and possibly never will.
11,journal-entry-11899,"This week  a friend offered to help me get a vaccination appointment. I’m not really eligible yet but could probably “get away with it”. I ultimately said I would do it as long as I didn’t have to lie to anyone. Nothing has happened yet. In the meantime I also pre-registered at my local mass vaccination sites, country site, DC site, and signed up to be “notified” when dependents are eligible. I’ve also been leaning into my status as a former smoker. I find it kind of hilarious and ironic that the history I used to be so ashamed of might save my life."
12,journal-entry-11889, I've embraced the Libertarian party or at least what I understand the Libertarian party stands for. Both Republicans + now Democrats are power hungry + not interested in helping people. Just looking to score political points + play the blame game. Biden seems completely disconnected. I never trusted elected officials to do anything right + now I am convinced they are the worst. Only the WHO + theCDC could screw up and make me doubt science.
13,journal-entry-11893," This week I saw my oncologist and was able to do some planning as to where we go from here. Having finished chemotherapy, I am able to finish the chemo cycle and look forward to scheduling an appointment for a Covid vaccination. This will give me some reassurance abut gradually dropping some of the restrictions I have been following for the past year. However, for me, as for others - perhaps more in my age range - that 'return' will probably be gradual. I see large crowds of people - mostly much younger than I - out at the restaurants downtown, and think that I don't have any desire to be in the middle of that. In truth, though, even before the pandemic, that's not a scene that I would often join.

But because of the season, being outside is appealing, and I think that sort of restaurant setting would be acceptable.

 I am encouraged to see the number of vaccinated people increasing, and also the desire by so many more to be vaccinated. It's a good trend and seems to signify a real turning the corner in attitude and aspiration."
14,journal-entry-11905," I see the need more than ever for some kind of universal health care for everyone. People have been devastated by this illness.

15,journal-entry-11697,"As I mentioned in the previous question, I plan on quitting my job. It's a great risk, and I'm not entirely sure I'd have enough savings to sustain me before I land another job. I've been working at this travel agency, a call center, for over 3 years now. I thought I'd stay for only a couple of years. The job is stable, and even during furlough I was lucky to be receiving a paycheck, albeit reduced. But the job goes against my values in travel. They're still booking cruises, for example, which was a major spreader of covid last year. The company is for-profit, which means it's for mass tourism. I feel like I'm part of the problem being there.

My job is mainly at the flight desk where the stress-level has skyrocketed, but this is probably true for all departments. For the most part, I do customer support fixing flight bookings, but also assist with resort and other reservations. It should be an easy job being on the phone 8 hours a day, but the back-to-back calls are insane. . .

I thought I'd stay at the job for a year, maybe two years. I had planned to quit last fall to visit family in Asia, even trek the Anapurna Trail. That didn't work out, needless to say, because of the pandemic. My plans for travel this year are more limited, as my funds are also. So, the job is a major source of anxiety and unhappiness, but quitting is also."
16,journal-entry-11690,"The country has started to reopen a bit. But it doesn't really change my life.

One of my jobs decided not to rehire me because it does not need part time staff because of the restrictions.

 It seems really strange that Denmark is opening while the countries around us and the rest of Europe seem to be reentering lockdowns.

I worry about that a lot. It makes me feel a lot less safe.

And I can't really seem to make sense of it rationally.

There'll still be restrictions. We have to carry covid certificates stating whether we have gotten the vaccine, have had covid, or have been tested in the last 72 hours. If we can't live up to any of these requirements, we're still affected by restrictions. So I will still be affected. My life probably won't change because as a student in her mid-twenties, my life doesn't seem to contribute to what is necessary for the economy or society to function. And I know I should be happy that I will not be forced to risk my life on a daily basis, but I also  really need to do something, to help with something, to contribute in some way"

I don't want to give a specific age in case you can make the ductions or anything like that. But those two don't go to school every day. My youngest has daycare but the other one hasn't gone to school since the pandemic started. So  I am at home by myself with my younger sibling trying to focus on school work and I find it very hard.

During this time my mom works with my dad, they go out every day and do work. So I'm with the children until they get back. I don't find it nice to complain because they are trying to support us and complaining isn't going to help them. But for right now I'm just struggling to do my school work.

18,journal-entry-11689," I feel a deep sense of grief about the traumatic experiences so many people are having with food insecurity, job loss, being trapped at home with abusers, the boredom and depression, COVID symptoms etc. All that compounded by the overt racism toward people who are black and brown, Asian and Pacific Islanders, LGBTQ. After devoting much of 2020 to electing Biden and a Democratic majority to Congress, I am exhausted and wondering how to have an impact in 2021 -- how to use my time, power, voice and money to best effect.

 America's scars from our original sins against indigenous, enslaved and abused-indentured populations have become open wounds -- infected by White supremacy.

Statement of Work

 COVID-19 and the Presidential election have profoundly changed our lives. I use an iPad to create digital abstract expressionism. I studied Art History at Cornell University. I gravitated to the Abstract Expressionist artists. My artwork is an expression of my subconscious. Faith and hope are sustained by leveraging the creative side of my brain. Art and music are part of my family history. My grandfather owned two music stores in Latvia. My father escaped the Nazis by coming to America in 1939 to see the New York World's Fair. My mother survived the Nazi occupation in the Riga ghetto along with her 2 brothers. They survived by singing for the Nazis who would protect them because they entertained the Nazis. Only 1 in 10 Latvian Jews survived the horror of the Holocaust. I consider myself a Latvian Unicorn. I channeled my sorrow about the Holocaust into the creation of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.. ...  The conditions of a pandemic that arbitrarily spreads a virus reminds me of the Holocaust and how much luck factors into survival. My abstract art captures my life, particularly when stress becomes more prevalent. We all require self care and creative projects give meaning to our lives in this unprecedented time.

There is a sameness to everything. My ""work"" is managing the home which doubled in size when Covid hit. Instead of just my husband and I, we now also have my millennial son, and 95 year old mother in law. I also have a number of volunteer activities, all now conducted via Zoom. I use to have the house to myself during weekdays; now I share with others, and am constantly searching for the best quiet place to work. I'm also constantly planning meals and grocery orders. We have gotten into a rhythm of sorts, and it is certainly easier now than in the beginning, but still it feels never-ending. Everyone does chip in, but still I miss going out to dinner and not having any dinner dishes. More importantly, I miss not having to take into account so many other's needs and wishes. I rarely feel ""alone"" here in the house. So, thank goodness, for long walks. Spring is truly finally here, and we will be able to use our patio once again, which will expand our house, and work area. The wifi works out there and sometimes one of us will take our laptop and sit outside for meetings or work. Two of us are vaccinated and hopefully the rest of us will be soon, also. In a few weeks, my mother in law will return to her home a few hours away. And in a few months, my son will start a graduate program elsewhere.

This past week I got my second vaccine, which I feel fortunate to have received - freed, in a way, to not fear the virus for my own health so much, and it also makes me more nervous that my kids haven't yet been vaccinated, which is almost a role-reversal - parents should be able to look out for their kids' health and safety above all else, but this time I have no control over it.

Mistakes have been made and agreed that some folks have slipped through some cracks but compared to the U.S, I really have no complaints to make. Universal health care, fast tracking of COVID support payments and quickly closing the southern border really helped make a huge difference.

Oh and taking this pandemic pretty seriously from the start helped too...seeing how some provincial governments dropped the ball (Alberta, looking at you here) has made it clear we need to continue to support good governance and helping each other. I know some people point fingers at my country and call us “Socialists” but damn, at least we try to care about each other and that’s been reflected in the much lower death rate versus some countries who consider themselves “Capitalists” first, in my opinion."

Traté de ir al supermercado un día y a una hora en la que sé que llegan pocas personas. Así que no habían muchas. Lo que hacía era que si alguien estaba en un pasillo, yo tomaba otro, y hasta después regresaba a buscar lo de ese pasillo.

 A pesar de esta terrible paranoia con la que me comporto para mantener la distancia, hubo un gesto amable de parte de una señora que estaba atrás de mí en la caja.

Can we accurately spot potential violent offenders? Or, is this the American way and are we destined to go down in history as a barbaric people, mindlessly killing each other for no reason, our leaders turning away?

I am haunted by questions like these.

I pray.

I journal.

It's made me realize how privileged I am to a degree that I had never truly processed. Although motherhood a few years ago had started this reflection in some respects, the pandemic has brought to light how urgent action is needed to solve many of our society's deepest issues (gender equality, racism, classism, police brutality, etc.) and  how I need to be part of that change if I want my kids to live in a better world."

Actualmente, logro acostarme a dormir más o menos a la misma hora cada día. Todavía me levanto en la madrugada para ir al baño una o dos veces, pero logro seguir durmiendo. Incluso hay días en los que duermo de corrido hasta el amanecer. Me levanto a la misma hora cada día. Es decir, ya logré establecer una rutina. Mi mamá me ayudó mucho para lograrlo. Además, el cuarto donde duermo (mi cuarto cuando fui niña y adolescente) tiene oscuridad total cuando se cierra la cortina.

 Lograr dormir de forma normal me ha ayudado mucho en relación con mi salud. Creo que tengo mejor ánimo y más capacidad para trabajar. 

Cuando tuve que realizar el trabajo que me pedían en un lapso corto, una de las reglas que me propuse fue no desvelarme. Trabajé muy duro todo el día, durante muchas horas, pero no sacrifiqué las horas de sueño. Antes, cuando no lograba conciliar el sueño, me dedicaba a trabajar. Enviaba archivos a las tres o cuatro de la mañana. Pero ya no lo hago más.

I had somewhat of a difficult time with my friendships in high school, with falling outs and such, and never quite feeling like I belonged. That sounds very cliché but it’s not uncommon among huge New York City public high schools. The beginning of quarantine was isolating for pretty much everyone. I liked that time because I would reflect a lot and have always been more of an introvert anyway. I upheld my closest friendships over that period but also spent most of my time with my family.

 College, even in a pandemic, was overwhelmingly filled with new friendships at every turn. I would even argue that we were making more friendships in the pandemic, subconsciously knowing that they’re more essential.

But as an American living abroad, I was dismayed and shocked by the random shootings in Atlanta, apparently aimed at Asian Americans. Both these issues are connected by their Coronavirus connection (ill will toward Asian Americans has soared in the past year because of the virus's origin). And I'd venture to say that both these issues arose through STUPIDITY AND HYSTERIA. There is no proven connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots; there is no connection between people going to nail salons in Atlanta and the origin of COVID-19.

If people had been put first, we might have been able to suppress the virus last year when we had the chance and the economy would not now be in such poor shape.

If people had been put first, there might not be so many dangerous variants threatening all the progress in treatment and vaccinations that we've made.

 As tragic as this year has been, this far surpasses everything: when it happens again in the future (because it will), we will do the exact same thing. Everything good will always be sacrificed for economic growth."
23,journal-entry-11327," A pod. I think the idea of a pod is a farce, mostly because everyone who has a pod includes others who have defined their own limits to who is in their pod. It has created an air of being safe, but the reality is far from that."
24,journal-entry-11272," It feels like people think the coronavirus pandemic is over. People are taking off their masks more or being less strict, people are socializing, people went out for St. Patty's day and acted like things were normal. It is so strange to see while at the same time we continue to consider that any patient with a cough and general malaise might have coronavirus. I know that more and more people have at least 1 vaccine, but it is still less than 15% of the population in our state. I think people are really ready to move forward.

 This week I was in a store and they had homemade masks for sale for $1. They were discounted from $10, which has been the going rate I have seen for a while. I bought two because the cloth masks I have are all getting a bit worn and it is nice to have one around in the car. The woman I bought it from said ""hopefully these are the last masks you will ever buy!"" I told her I thought they would come in handy in the future. I know that the masks are part performance because many of them are badly fitted or clearly inadequate (synthetic neck gaiters, I am looking at you). But they also may be protective or at least lessen our risk of transmission.

I feel like I will continue to wear masks when I am in contact with patients with URIs, and probably throughout flu season in the future. I had the flu once in 2010, I believe that it was the H1N1 variant because that was circulating at the university I was attending, and my room mate and many friends at the time had similar symptoms. I was so sick for 5 days, I missed a week of school and felt terrible. I have also caught multiple colds from interacting with patients when I go to work in clinic. I don't need to go through that every year!

 When I traveled in Asia in 2009 I bought a cloth face mask because it had a cute print on it. I didn't ever use it and I don't know what I did with it, but in 2020 I regretted that lost track of it. I saw many people in Korea and China wearing masks when they were out in public, especially when I was there in the winter. It seems like it is a respectful way to protect those around you or protect yourself. At times in China I wore N95 masks when I was out because the air quality was terrible and I would cough and sneeze as soon as I left the house. I think that masks will come in handy many times in the future. The way we interact with the world brings these infectious diseases into contact with more and more people all the time. Additionally, climate change and pollution make it likely that we will benefit from wearing these in the future when the air quality is bad."
25,journal-entry-11241," I finally got an appointment for a vaccine, and got the first shot a couple days ago.

 The feeling of ""it's too good to be true"" is overwhelming. It's no exaggeration, I simply can't imagine being safe from the virus.

I know I won't be protected until 2 weeks after the second shot, but just the thought of life without this all-encompassing fear and sorrow is unimaginable. Literally unimaginable.

And, in a stroke of irony, the day I got my shot, our state health department announced that the new varient has been found in my extremely remote county and the surrounding counties, and is causing a surge in new cases. I live in a town that was designated 'the middle of nowhere', as it is furthest from any metropolitan area of any town in the US. It's a two and a half hour drive to the nearest larger town. Yet the variant is here, and if it's in the middle of nowhere, it is everywhere. More fear, can't escape it yet.

 Stay safe. Wear your mask. Please get your vaccine when it's available to you."

2,journal-entry-11282," My oldest son is in his second year of teaching sixth graders in a small school district in a more rural part of the state. He was very fortunate to get his first shot a week before his district was set to open up to in school learning. That opening was postponed for a week due to a fellow teacher testing positive and possible exposure to the other teachers at a pre-opening meeting.

 Michigan, where we live, is currently seeing a rapid rise of cases that has catapulted us from 45 best in the country to third worst in the number of cases in just a few weeks. According to my son, his area of the state has seen a rapid rise in cases. He told me that teaching is very difficult because between in class and on line, he can not keep track of the children. A student will disappear for a few days before he learns that that child is in quarantine. Being in quarantine to the student, often means they don't have to go to school both in person and on line. He is seeing his students fall behind in their learning and often has no way of contacting or reaching out to that child. Consistence in schedule is always best for children and today, with his school, it is constantly changing schedule.

 You hear on the news, the challenges and stresses of the teachers trying their best to educate our country's children. My son is a natural teacher, his personality is very compatible to teaching. This pandemic has been hard on the most seasoned of teachers, but this pandemic has been most of his teaching experience. . As his mother, it is hard to hear the challenges in his voice."
3,journal-entry-11185," I was a remote student at my college last semester. One of the mandatory classes that all freshman have to take at my college is the Scribner Seminar. I signed up for one that was labeled as hybrid, thinking that there would be half of the students online and half of the students in person. I was the only online student in the class.

 Two times a week my professor would set her laptop on top of a lazy susan and I would log onto zoom. I would watch as my classmates entered the room, wiping down the chairs and getting situated for the class. Most days I was forgotten about, but when I was remembered, one of my peers would swivel the laptop around so that I could see whoever was speaking.

 Being online for college wasn't much of a change from finishing high school online. By then I had created a routine - run/walk three miles, make oatmeal, get ready for class, and finally attend class. I loved my routines, I was active, had time to make healthy meals, and I was exploring the town I grew up in as an adult (a much different experience then when you are little).

 This semester I am in person at my school. I am only close with four people on campus and I am going through the acclimation period every other freshman went though last fall. It is definitely different, however it is totally worth it whenever one of my classmates from the seminar go out of their way to say hi and seem genuinely happy to finally meet me in person."

I think I've also realized that self-suppression is so real. Even though I'm Asian American, I find myself thinking ""try not to make noise, people don't think this is a big deal"". That's the problem though - people don't think the Asian-American discrimination and violence is a big deal. I should be making noise, we should be being loud and asking why our issues have not been prioritized and why there is rarely any news coverage on it as well.

7,journal-entry-11095," Vaccine Envy has preoccupied me in the past week. I'm not proud of this emotion, and it is one I am unfamiliar with. I have always been content and appreciative of my ""place"" in my community. I am grateful for having a loving family and supportive friends; people to be ""quiet"" with and people to have fun with. I know I'm fortunate for being secure financially and having the resources needed to stay healthy and well. Therefore it has surprised me how much I am tired of hearing of others' good fortunate in securing a vaccine appointment. I am happy for them but also very frustrated at how long it will take me, and my son to be eligible in our state for the Covid vaccine. I think if I was a young adult or younger adult, perhaps it would bother me less, knowing that I am at the back of the line. But being in the 55-64 decade means that I have family and friends older than me who have been vaccinated, and that in many other parts of the country, Governors have modified eligibility to allow people my age and younger to register for appointments. Whereas my state, Maryland, has not, and doesn't appear likely to do so. I feel as though other people are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and I am still stuck deep in the tunnel. I feel as though they have landed on the ""get out of jail for free"" card on the Monopoly board, and my roll of die isn't getting me there. I was all for making health care providers and essential front line workers and those over 75 and then 65 the top priorities. For 6 weeks, we've been prioritizing these groups and there has been huge progress. But there is no indication of when they will actually get to the under 65 population, when so many other states have opened the doors. And it seems like this is the topic that everyone is talking about - how to find ""left over vaccines"" at pharmacies at the end of the day; how to use your health conditions or employment status to your benefit. We all know young folks whose work is completely virtual who have snagged appointments based on employer. Trying to be patient is hard!"
8,journal-entry-11150," Coronavirus sucks. Plus it we had a lot of gray days this week, which also sucked. Me and my friends coined gray days when I was noticeable sadder on rainy cold days. I'm sure we didn't actually come up with it, but we started to make that term more commonplace within just the five of us.  If it was a rainy, cold, shitty day, one of us would remark, ""oh, a gray day."" It made it a little better putting a name to it.

Now that I think about it, me and my friends have a lot of terms that we've coined, just among ourselves. We have this term called a 'twenty-four hour thing', where if one of us accidentally said something just a little too mean, we could let them know by telling them that was a 'twenty-four hour thing'; something we would obsess over and pick at for at least the next 24 hours. It was essentially a way of expressing that the other person had landed a little too close to home with a remark they'd made.

I think the worst part of this pandemic is how distanced I am from every one, especially my friends - thinking about our little things that we had to ourselves makes me miss them a little bit more than I already do. I spent about 16-17 hours on facetime with them this past week alone, which should say a lot about how much I need to have them present. I know I sound like a broken record, but the isolation affects me to a point where I think about it and feel it all the time."
9,journal-entry-11108," I have not worked in the past year. I have applied to jobs. I have had interviews. I have not received any offers. In recent months I have felt too depressed to apply for work. I am afraid of the rejection. I am afraid that people will and do think I'm too old. I am afraid that I have reached the end of my working life with good jobs. I am afraid that the best I can hope for will be the Amazon warehouse. I am sad to think that I may never have enough money to retire. I am sad to think that I will never have enough income to save for either retirement or vacations. I think owning a home is completely out of the realm of possibility for me now. I will rent for the rest of my life. I am embarrassed and ashamed of being unemployed. But my work history has been spotty and embarrassing for some time. I am afraid I will never have a chance at redemption. Redemption would be landing a good job, the last job, one that I enjoy, find suitably challenging, with opportunity to grow.  I am afraid that is not longer possible for me.

11,journal-entry-11145," Exactly a year into the pandemic, I am restless and tired of it. Although I console myself with the fact that my family is extremely lucky -- we have adequate money, good housing, stable jobs -- it is still a strain to be living this odd half life, cut off from many of the things and people we love.

The world and people are visible to us mainly through screens and at a distance. I heard a song by Nick Jonas, ""Spaceman,"" in which he sings of his distance from others, and not being able to ""get to them."" He based it on his quarantine experience and the imagery captures the odd alienation so well.

However, there is hope on the horizon. My husband got his first vaccine today, and in two days, I get mine. This is thrilling! Despite all the PSAs urging people to take the shot, it was remarkably hard to schedule. Supply has not kept up with demand and one has to stay up late at night, multiple tabs open on one's laptop, to find an open appointment, whether it's through an official govt. channel or at a drug store or a super market. Absurd and very frustrating.

 We did a smart thing though -- got our tech-savvy millennial kids to find us an appt. Using a special Twitter alert, they nailed it in a day! My 64-year-old husband had tears in his eyes when he got off the phone, having learned that our second born secured him a slot! I like to frame it up this way: When they were babies, we bundled up our daughters and took them to the doctor to be vaccinated. Now, they are doing this for us! The tables are turned.

Although I am thrilled at returning to a more normal existence, i also worry that I will have difficulty with re-entry. That I will be anxious even in small groups of people. That I will feel extremely uncomfortable when strangers are close to me. I wonder if I am normal, or if these anxieties will simply melt away, like last week's snow. In the scheme of things, minor. Still, a source of worry."

Not the best moment, especially because the situation does not seem to have evolved so much. And just today, for like a crual irony, we entered back into a lockdown here in Paris. Again, the end seems to be further and further.

14,journal-entry-3796,"Sí, me preocupa el impacto de la pandemia en los niños, tanto de forma general como en el niño (mi sobrino) que tengo más cerca en mi vida.

De manera general, me preocupa el acceso a alimentos y a educación de los niños de mi país. La desnutrición siempre ha sido un serio problema y ha campeado en mi país, pero esta pandemia vino a poner las cosas más difíciles. Muchos niños dependían de la comida que se les daba en la escuela y aunque el Ministerio de Educación decidió dar bolsas con alimentos, se ha visto que en algunos lugares, la bolsa no lleva la cantidad de alimentos requerida, es decir, se están quedan con el dinero en los establecimientos educativos (corrupción).

El acceso a educación de la población infantil, en general, siempre ha sido por debajo de la cobertura universal. Ahora, muchos niños dejarán de cursar la preprimaria y una gran cantidad de niños probablemente han desertado o desertarán del sistema educativo oficial. Este retroceso serán grande y será generacional.

 Me preocupa mi sobrino porque, aunque tiene acceso a mejores condiciones educativas que la mayoría de la población, la pandemia lo tiene recluido en la casa. La educación a distancia que recibió este año no se puede comparar con la educación presencial que recibía anteriormente,  aunque el establecimiento educativo haya hecho su mejor esfuerzo. Asignaturas que le han sido difíciles siempre, como matemáticas, en la distancia, se volvieron aún más difíciles.

 Mantiene la relación con sus compañeros de manera virtual, pero eso no sustituye la convivencia presencial que aporta una infinidad de aprendizajes sobre las relaciones sociales, los conflictos, la amistad y los valores que necesita experimentar y aprender con sus pares para vivir en sociedad.  Además, su actividad física también disminuyó grandemente. Nunca ha sido un joven muy activo, pero el confinamiento le dio una justificación para moverse aún menos. En el establecimiento educativo debía realizar ejercicio físico y algún deporte. Eso ha sido borrado de su vida en esto meses."

21,journal-entry-10856,"Since the pandemic started, our work has been so slow it's practically no work at all. We (my husband and I) own a graphic design/web site/marketing company that's been operating since 1990.

The bulk of our clients are non-profits or school districts. We do custom web sites, newsletters, advertising, and that kind of stuff. And nobody really wants anything right now. I'm pretty sure when I filed my personal taxes for 2020, I had negative income. That's not going to be helpful in the world of retirement.

We've done a couple of catalogs for one client, but it's half the work we normally do. Our school districts by now would have had several newsletters and other projects, but have given us nothing. Our non-profits would be gearing up for spring fundraising galas and annual reports, but there's nothing happening there either.

 Thank goodness for unemployment, the EIDL and PPP. Without those, we would have been homeless a year ago.  I don't like that we've had to go into debt to stay afloat, but it's better than living in a tent somewhere.

Milling around also waiting for leftovers were people in a similar demographic as us – young (definitely under 40), probably WFH. Most of the group waiting were white people.

 I felt so conflicted the whole time - obviously we are not considered an eligible group, but ethically if the shots are going to waste, it's better to just use them anyway and increase vaccination. Some other people were chit chatting as they were waiting but I couldn't bring myself to; it somehow felt inappropriate in the face of the inequality of vaccine distribution, that we also happened to be benefiting from. I don't know.

It was a Pfizer dose, first of two. The Walgreens wouldn't schedule a second dose, so in 3-6 weeks we'll have to play the same game of seeing what's available.

Surprisingly, it was the most painless shot I've ever had. I didn't even feel it in my shoulder. My arm was pretty sore the day after - anything touching it made it sore - but now it's only if I raise my arm quite high, and it doesn't hurt, it's just there.

8,journal-entry-10676,"I think that the biggest change to come out of this pandemic is the exposure to the lack of preparedness in this countries health system along with showing how much disparity exists in the health field. Of the many historical things to come out of this pandemic, the one thing I will never be able to reconcile with is images of nurses having to wear trash bags to protect themselves, along with health care workers reusing masks and other vital equipment due to the fear of shortages. Americans are quick to think of our hospital systems as the most advanced in the world. While we may have expensive machines and fancy new wards popping up left and right, they are of no use if there physically aren't people to use them. A hospital without nurses, doctors, faculty, staff, therapists, social workers and coordinators is just an expensive building filled with expensive machinery. Through the COVID pandemic it has been made crystal clear that this country was not prepared to deal with something of this magnitude. While it may be fair to think that the government deserves some slack because they don't have a crystal ball and couldn't predict the future and this pandemic, they did in fact have a crystal ball. It's called science. Leading epidemiologists and virologists around the world had been saying that from analyzing past patterns of epidemics including the spanish flu and other outbreaks that it was just a matter of time before the next disease came. If people in positions of authority had put trust into the science, we could have had stockpiles of PPE ready or hospital workers. But no, instead while people sat at home and quarantined, nurses had to wear trash bags and ski goggles.  This pandemic has highlighted the cracks in the foundation of how this society treats science as a whole. A world where thousands of people don't die from preventable illness is the same world where science is trusted and upheld above the opinions of those who have no idea what is happening."

Overall, I feel rather irritated much of the time, but I try to focus  my mind on positive things, such as the possibility that I might see my family in Germany again in a few months. The joy of that prospect is diminished by the fact that my mum passed away last December,  but it would be good to see the rest of my family again.

21,journal-entry-10511," Yesterday was the one-year anniversary of WHO declaring Covid as a pandemic, so lots of memories swirling around thinking back to one year ago.

 I was on a Rotary service project in Guatemala. Learning about and working with Wakami. I don’t remember actually hearing about the pandemic being declared per se. There had been no reported cases in Guatemala, so we felt like we were in a safety bubble. We did go to one nice restaurant and temperatures were taken. Coming off the plane, temperatures were taken. In the States (we left from LAX), all we noticed different were hand sanitizers everywhere.

News was not something we were paying too much attention to. On Monday, our second day in country, the stock market tanked. Two days later, one or my fellow travelers got word that the local schools were shutting down. It was surreal.

As we approached FRIDAY, the day before we were leaving, we learned that flights in and out of Guatemala were being halted by Monday. We basically just made it out.

 Flying into LAX, still no precautions at all like we had seen in Guatemala. When I was going through security to catch my connecting flight from LAX to sacramento, my small jar of hand sanitizer was confiscated and tossed. I was so pissed. How much sense does that make when it was a product you could find anywhere. And this was before airlines were doing all the cleaning they were doing. Absolutely ridiculous!

 I haven’t thought of that last experience for some time. Still pisses me off. Clearly an example of things to come where we as a country did not fully have our act together. Imagine if we had indicated everyone should be wearing masks from day 1, but didn’t because we didn’t want to take PPE away from health providers.

 Does feel like we are coming to the final phase of this experience that will be studied for generations to come. I only hope we learn our lessons and don’t find this to be the prelude of worse pandemics to come."
22,journal-entry-10522," This is the anniversary of our quarantine year. Days are warmer and lighter, bringing back memories of the frightening and disorienting start of the pandemic. This is a confusing time for me: so many people have had their vaccines and can shift toward the new normal. I'm in phase 2 so am waiting, feeling depleted, feeling a confusing mix of hope, anger, fear, exhaustion and confusion.

 Work flows forward, filling my days -- some productive, some not. Despite my best efforts, I'm strangely less attuned to details. I forget to send dial-in details for Zooms, forget to cc key people, skip ahead in processes in ways that I might not have before. Maybe because of the isolation, I feel a lot of anxiety about these mess ups. I'm a freelance writer and editor so maintaining strong relationships with clients is crucial to my future earnings.

 I am doing the best I can. I'm trying to simplify my life with fewer volunteer involvements so that i can maintain better focus and carve out more time for well-being, self-care and peace of mind. I ordered seeds, potting soil and pots, and am eager to begin work on this year's garden. The snow drops are blooming in my garden. I look forward to trimming the lavender back for new growth, and am excited for a new well-contained bed of mint to grow so I can cook with this.

 Last night was President Biden's first address to the American people. His quiet kindness and calm, his competence and determination to help is a balm to my soul. I am terrified by the presence of so many people who are determined to deny voting rights to others. This moment of hope feels way too fragile."

Los extraño mucho, los quiero abrazar y siento que no pase el tiempo suficiente con ellos, a pesar que los veía a diario, cuando digo a diario es por que incluso los domingos teníamos trabajo juntos.

 Como todo el mundo, la última vez que nos vimos, nos abrazamos sin saber que era la ultima vez que nos veríamos.

2,journal-entry-10456," Today, I feel a sense of hope and of contemplation for the year that has been. Today, marks the one year anniversary of the start of the pandemic. A year ago at this time, my husband and I began a six month journey of waiting for his liver transplant. We began living in a community facility far from our home in one tiny room. There we would stay for six months and two days. At the time, we didn't know the pandemic would effect every part of our lives including his ability to receive a liver.

 I am grateful for the strength of our marriage. This time away from home, living under restrictions, and waiting for a liver donor asked much of us. I learned that turning back or turning away from our circumstances wasn't an option. Every day, we had to recommit to the process of waiting, living under strict conditions. To cope, we focused on one day at time, sometimes one hour at a time. There were days of despair. I learned to embrace those days, giving myself the grace to struggle. Then my spirit would lift, and I would turn back to the job at hand of caring and supporting my spouse in his time of great need.

 This learned ability to keep moving forward has given me a reserve of strength that I can call on now. The deep bond that I have with my husband brings me great comfort. We will always be a team.

 My husband received his liver transplant in the middle of a pandemic. His medical team never gave up on him and they cradled us in their care. They are our heroes.

As of yesterday, we are both fully vaccinated.

 I feel a sense of lightness, of hope that the days ahead will bring us joy. I feel grateful for all that I have learned."

4,journal-entry-10424," It was a year ago today that the WHO declared a pandemic. Life has changed. This week I went to my medical appointments; did my grocery shopping....basically went about my life. It no longer feels strange nor does it induces high anxiety to wear a mask, stay physically distanced or use hand sanitizer when entering or leaving stores. This week I watched a video broadcast about the rollout of vaccines in my area. It will be a month or more before I will get my shot in the arm but I am looking forward to a little more freedom and peace of mind."

Meanwhile my husband and son are both home. My 3 year old is out of preschool again all week this week because he has a runny nose and can’t go back until he’s been 72 hours symptom free. It’s the kind of runny nose where during normal times I wouldn’t even consider keeping him home even a day. But here we are both working truncated days for an entire week again because of a little bit of snot. And the kiddo runs circles around the house and us."
6,journal-entry-10355,"Coronavirus has affected me in significant ways, like not taking in-person classes, not being able to see my elderly family members (being Hispanic, this means a lot,) having to become a teacher to my eleven years old son, etc. However, I think that the more bothersome ways are the little things that we have to do every day like, making sure to have a mask every time we go out, remembering not to touch anything that we don't have to touch, washing our hands all the time, etc. They are like little stones in your shoe, they might not be a big deal at the beginning, but now you have bruised feet and can't walk. The fact that my husband has to work every day and come home not knowing if he somehow got infected is distressing. Anyway, I feel I can't complain. Although my husband was out of work for two months and we are NOT receiving any government help due to our immigration status (it's complicated), we had enough savings to pay rent for those two months. The local food pantry (run by another person with a ""complicated"" immigration status also) helped us survive. So although I am very bitter towards the Trump administration and everything it did to dehumanize me and mine, I am very grateful to my community and neighbors that have been there for us. Now, this week has been a good one. I received a notification that my son's school might be returning to in-person classes. Also,  spring is in the air. We have roses in our rosebush, and there has been intermittent rain which is great here in California. I feel hopeful of the future and can't wait to see my elderly aunt (I hope she never finds out I called her elderly.) She received the last dose of the vaccine two weeks ago, and this weekend is her birthday. I am so looking forward to seeing her!"
7,journal-entry-10403," This week, I read a lot of interesting articles that underlined the importance of:

a) taking the time to grieve the losses inflicted by COVID (not just the loss of loved ones or the loss of physical health for those suffering from long COVID, but also the loss of our routines, our certainty about the future, potential friendships, experiences, etc.)

b) recognizing that COVID is a mass trauma that is bound to have specific psychological effects.

 I suspect that the timing is because we are one year into the pandemic, and anniversaries are usually a time to reflect.

The articles on grief remind me of a quote from The Office, where Michael says: ""It is my job to get them all the way through to acceptance, and, if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job."" It's weird because I feel depressed all the time and the memes on Zoom Memes for Self Quaranteens suggest that pretty much everyone (at least young people) are going through something like depression. So I'd have assumed we were ""almost all the way there"". And yet when I think about it, I realize that as a society, we haven't even begun the grieving process. As a society I feel like we're stuck in denial. Denial in the sense that I keep hearing this constant refrain of ""Once all this is over, everything will be back to normal"". It's not just individuals I hear this from, it's institutions. As far as I can gather, my university is planning for everything to resume ""as normal"" starting this fall: all students living on campus, all or mostly in-person classes, student gatherings permitted, with maybe the only big change being masks required in public places. But the problem is that the more people repeat this refrain of ""everything will be back to normal"", the more they delay that process of realizing that normal is never coming back. Sure, the *trappings* of normality will return: we'll be able to go back to the office, hang out with our friends guilt-free and go to bars and such. But from a psychological perspective, we will never be the same again. We will never go out and meet new people with as much reckless abandon as we used to. We will never plan our future with the same confidence that things will work out. We will never have the same faith and trust we used to in our institutions. I think people repeat this refrain of ""back to normal"" so often because they don't want to acknowledge that they lost something. They want to imagine that quarantine and shutdown was like taking down a tent, folding it up, and putting it in a closet until better weather comes around. Whereas in reality, quarantine and shutdown was more like demolishing a house. Sure, you can rebuild the house according to your initial blueprint, but your new house will never be the same as the old house. Maybe the paint you used for the outside just isn't sold anymore, or maybe the stair steps are just a little too high. That doesn't mean that your new house is bad; in fact, your new house may be better in some ways (maybe you got double-paned windows and you rewired the electricity to optimize for solar panels). But I don't think you can really fully appreciate the new house until you accept that the old house is gone and trying to resurrect it is futile.

 I personally find myself hard pressed to treat my personal losses as something to grieve when society does not see it that way. It's frustrating because I do think that I need to go through that grieving/healing process, and as a society we need to do so as well. But it's hard when no one else sees it that way. I keep hearing over and over from well-meaning friends, through social media, through some news articles: ""Don't fret, don't worry, everything will go back to normal eventually"". That was a nice message maybe in March or April 2020,  But one full year into this pandemic, I'm really starting to get ticked off by that well-meaning message. I mean, to take this to Gogolian extremes, imagine its being 2025 and fears about COVID still abounding, and people still saying ""Don't worry, everything will go back to normal eventually"". At some point, you have to realize that ""normal"" in the sense of the Before Times is never coming back. The longer you put that off, the harder you're going to have to work to live with that sense of loss and figure out what you're going to do next. I think this all the time when seeing my classmates taking gap years in the hope that campus life will be ""back to normal"" by the time they finish their gap year, or enrolling last minute in a fifth-year master's so that it can replace the ""normal senior year"" they lost. I can understand the sentiment behind taking a gap year or coterming: you want to buy time for things to at least be *less* miserable than they are now (and in all fairness, I do despise Zoom University). At the same time, how many gap years are you willing to take before things are ""normal enough"" for you to come back? I don't feel like a lot of people asked themselves this hard question before making these big decisions, and as the next academic year approaches with little to no certainty about how ""normal"" things will be, I worry it will come back to haunt them.

The mass trauma article was by the BBC, and I found it fascinating because I think that much as we have repeated the constant refrain of ""once this is over, everything will be back to normal"", we have also refused to acknowledge the massive psychological toll that the sustained, prolonged fear of disease and death, coupled with the brutal economic toll and the mass isolation, has already had and will continue to have down the line. A lot of us act and talk like we're the ones who are crazy for not having ""adapted"" and ""proven our resilience"" ""already"". I am personally guilty of constantly scolding myself: ""I should be grateful for all my privilege, I shouldn't be so dour and gloomy"". Or: ""I should have gotten used to Zoom University already, so any lack of motivation I experience is a sign of personal weakness"". I think there are two things at play: the individual need to believe that we are invincible to COVID gloominess, and the relentless demands of a capitalist world for us to keep our heads down and keep producing. (Thanks, capitalism!)  I worry that I'm not coping in a healthy way (I feel addicted to social media in that I delay meals and exhaust my eyes just to see one more ""interesting"" post and suffer from restlessness and intense boredom when I block social media), and I also fear that COVID trauma is going to make me into a fearful, paranoid, dour, even spiteful person."

For some reason, I almost wept as I walked to the beach. I don't know why. I think the podcast reminded me that I was doing the best I can. That, successfully, I got out of bed even without the aid of the podcast and was going to the beach to walk and breathe and meditate in motion. I was doing my best. Yet  it also reminded me that I wanted to walk with someone who wasn't there, someone I will probably never see not only because she's so far away, but also because she's walking with someone else.

9,journal-entry-10393,"Pre-pandemic my husband and I had a group of friends that we saw regularly (every month or two). We've kept in touch with most of them via text, Zoom, and a handful of small in-person outdoor gatherings. But it's not the same.

 I find myself feeling resentful of friends who are thriving in the pandemic--taking up crafting, cooking, and roller skating, enjoying remote relationships they established pre-pandemic, etc. I am not thriving. I am keeping my head down and trudging through each day, regularly questioning the point of any of this.

I have struggled with bouts of depression and feel like I have no one to talk to about it. Everyone is depressed, and the people who aren't depressed make me feel like I just need to get over myself. It's lonely. I hope when all the adults are vaccinated, things can get back to something that resembles normal, but I do feel like there's a kind of river between me and the people I call friends right now.

Hola, soy M., los saludo desde la comuna [...] de Medellín, Colombia. Voy a contarles cómo me sentí cuando nos contagiamos papá y yo de covid.

Cuando dejaron salir a los adultos mayores,  mi papá, de 72 años, salió a trabajar, vino sintiéndose muy mal y a los dos días ya tenia fiebre y malestar en el cuerpo. 5 días después lo llevamos a urgencias y no le hicieron nada, ni la prueba. Lo mandaron a la casa, al otro día llamó un médico a su celular y le dijo que 5 días después le harían la prueba, le llevarían la medicina.  Pero no, nada. Tuve que poner la queja en la superintendencia de salud y ahí si vinieron. Le pagamos la prueba rcp y salió positiva.

Sólo le mandaron acetaminofen y cetirizina, nada más. Como yo lo estaba cuidando, me infecte. Sentí muchísimo dolor en mis articulaciones, la boca era seca, me dio muchísima diarrea y mi cuerpo era pesado.  No podía dormir porque debía reportar los signos vitales de papá cada 4 horas y eso hizo más agudos mis síntomas de fatiga.  La eps no envió prueba por cerco epidemiológico con mi papá.  Fueron los 18 días más eternos que he vivido.  Sólo nos contagiados nosotros dos.

Cuando me dieron el alta, caminé 3 cuadras y me sentí muy mal, me sentía muy débil. Incluso un mes después intenté nadar y no pude, me ahogue nadando.  Y aun hoy, marzo de 2021, sigo con problemas de diarreas con algunas comidas. Bajé 5 kilos con eso, papá ya recuperó el olfato pero a veces dice que siente malestar en las piernas.

I also looked at the written ""pandemic journal"" that I started last March. My first journal entry spoke of the despair of going into lockdown for 4-6 weeks. I actually laughed when I read it. :-)"
19,journal-entry-10159," Only one thought this week: Why is it so hard to find a vaccination? So many people are getting vaccinated and we are having no luck finding anything.

And why is the media saying ""nobody will want the J&J vaccine because of the lower percentage of effectiveness."" Seriously? It's one shot and done. Fewer side effects. I want that shot!

We'll just keep plugging away.  I can at least buy a lottery ticket for my chance to win. I can't even find a vaccine. "
20,journal-entry-10174,Covid lockdown has put more pressure on my husband to be my social group. Would normally been traveling to see my grandkids this time of year. All my volunteer jobs still on hold. Thinking at least we are not in a war zone and this won't last forever.
21,journal-entry-10206," Out of the blue I received a text from a friend telling me I could apply to the Pharmacy for the Covid vaccine

According to the information online, I didn't think I was eligible till much later.

 But it was straight forward and I was booked for my first Pfizer vaccine towards the end of this month. That was a surprise and I was very thankful to be included. My husband is a few years younger than me, and he was not accepted into this group. I called the 811 number to find out when he could get vaccinated and was given the details.

 Unfortunately the details on the websites are not quite accurate and seem to be changing day to day. But as the pharmacist pointed out, the vaccines are here and more are on the way, so eventually we'll all be given the shot.

People are questioning whether one particular vaccine is better than the others, but from what I can gather, they all do the same job and are effective.

 I didn't think we'd be vaccinated till the fall, so this is wonderful news."
22,journal-entry-10223," The level of fear has gone up to the sky. You walk down a sidewalk and you dodge anyone who is walking towards you. I don’t know anyone who is traveling, either for work or pleasure. The skies are mostly empty of planes and I live on a flight path  usually busy with planes heading to Asia, India and the South Pacific, planes heading south from Alaska to the continental US, etc.

23,journal-entry-10242," How has the coronavirus affected my closest relationships?

I can't even begin to answer this fully.

 I miss my mother, desperately. She is alive and well and only two hours but a world away. I miss her voice, I miss the gentle way she brushes my daughter's hair. Their banter back and forth heard through the wall, two melodic voices in different registers, a tinkling brook of dialogue. I miss taking walks with her, riding the train on a Saturday morning to visit her, the way she always makes sure to have good coffee in the house when I visit. Her shabby apartment where she's lived for twenty years, the wiggly kitchen table, the knick knacks, the too-warm bathroom and the picture window above the kitchen sink. Her silly little Honda Fit that rattles around back roads of Vermont when she drives to swimming holes and places to walk. How she will talk to anyone kindly, any person in any context for any reason. How she never cuts corners, almost to a maddening degree, never does a shitty job with anything, never treats anyone as an afterthought. How she writes the best letters and cards and makes the best Valentines. How she believes in things. How she loves lavender and birdsong. How she misses the sea."
24,journal-entry-6105," Hace un momento vino una ambulancia a una casa vecina. Es probable que alguien de esa familia tenga COVID-19 , pero, en este momento, los servicios de salud están saturados. Es probable que los casos leves o que pueden estar bajo control no sean trasladados a un hospital. Varios de los vecinos salimos a observar lo que ocurría.

Como vivo con mi mamá, ella dispuso que saldremos solamente por cuestiones estrictamente necesarias. Entonces, salimos solamente al mercado o al supermercado. Las compras navideñas, la mayoría, las hice por internet. Otros años, a mi mamá le gustaba que la llevara a varias tiendas a buscar los regalos. Este año no lo hicimos para protegernos del contagio. Otro lugar al que tenemos que ir es al banco o a los cajeros automáticos para tener el dinero que necesitamos, o en mi caso, para cobrar mis trabajos.

Me gusta vivir con mi mamá porque, tanto ella como yo, somos altamente vulnerables al COVID-19, entonces, nos apoyamos entre nosotras.

Ya me estoy haciendo a la idea de que la celebración de la Navidad va a ser rara y que no nos vamos a reunir como antes. Pero no me voy a desanimar. Voy a celebrar que hemos logrado llegar hasta acá y estoy viva. Voy a celebrar que mi familia está completa y nadie se ha enfermado ni ha fallecido. Ese será el mejor regalo de Navidad."

I'm from South East Asia so I'm a little safer from harassment since we don't fit into the typical Asian stereotype as far as looks go, and sometimes I feel guilty because I feel very relieved I don't have to go through such discrimination. But what about other Asians?

 The world is messed up, and major events like a pandemic can really bring out the worst in people. It's really sad."
1,journal-entry-10013," In my work as a Palliative Care nurse coronavirus is still looming and causing upheaval. Just last week I cared for an elderly 91 year old gentleman who had a massive stroke and also had coronavirus. He had tested positive in the fall, and had even had his first vaccine. False positive? How can we know? There is still so much fear around this disease and so much we do not know. I had to make a decision whether or not to allow his own unvaccinated daughter into the room prior to removing him from the ventilator, which he had outlined in his advanced directives. I finally left the decision up to her, going against some of the hospital's policies. I hope I made the right decision and that she did not get sick. He died a couple hours later, peacefully, with his wife and daughter with him. This consumed my day, yet they were not my only patients. In a hospital setting right now, the stakes are so high and we still face unknowns every single day and I feel like  everyone on the outside is pushing for the world to open back up as spring is coming and everyone is sick of staying home and inside. I am too, but my anxiety about what happens next is very stirring and 'getting back to normal' seems like an obsolete statement. The way I see it is that we must 'go forward with a new hope for wellness' instead."
2,journal-entry-9912," I worry about my mom through this, in part because she says she is afraid she would be allergic to the vaccine. I don’t believe her. She decided to work a cashier job after being laid off from her previous job. I begged her not to, not only because of covid but also because there are other jobs that she could do that would make her happier. I wish she would not think that she would get anaphylaxis from a vaccine, considering the rarity of it, but at the very least everyone else in the family seems to be getting more access to it. I’m lucky in that regard. It was a huge load off my mind after my dad got the vaccine."
3,journal-entry-8221," Parecerá una gran ingenuidad, pero solamente hasta tiempos recientes fui consciente de que no existe un sentido de ""justicia"" en lo ocurre en la vida o en la sociedad.  Tanto el desmoronamiento de mi vida en el 2015 como el desmoronamiento de la vida que conocíamos en el 2020 con el COVID 19 fueron grandes momentos para saber y experimentar que  no existe justicia posible que te salve de lo inevitable. 

En las últimas semanas he sabido de personas con grandes fortunas, que invirtieron grandes cantidades de dinero en hospitales para intentar salvarse de los efectos del COVID 19 en sus organismos y nada de ello sirvió para evitar que murieran. Aquí hablamos más de grandes recursos financieros y no de justicia, pero igual: personas con grandes contribuciones a la sociedad, buenas personas, gente que tenía un futuro que aportar han desaparecido en esta hecatombe y no hay justicia que los haya salvado.

 Yo creía que si hacías A + B + C el resultado sería justo. Y no. El resultado puede ser cualquier cosa. Y puede ser cualquier cosa que esté totalmente fuera de tu control. La incertidumbre es la norma de nuestros tiempos. Esto vuelve loca a la gente. De verdad. No tener control, no saber qué pasará, cuándo o cómo. 

En mi país, la vacuna no llega. Sé que hay grupos poblacionales a los que les tiene sin cuidado la falta de vacunas, incluso el COVID 19 mismo. Supongo, porque no lo he estudiado a conciencia, que es una cuestión cultural. No les importa, este es un ladrillo más en el desastre cotidiano, una razón más para la muerte, una cosa que vendrá y desaparecerá y no merece su atención, ni ningún cambio fundamental en sus vidas.

Pero en las zonas más urbanas sí importa que no hayan vacunas a estas alturas. Sí importa. Especialmente por todos los médicos y personal de hospitales que están atendiendo a los enfermos. Es increíble la incapacidad del gobierno."
4,journal-entry-9992,"People in my immediate community are supportive. And I mostly don't associate with those that don't that don't believe in government or community, so my friends and family have been supportive as well. My parents had a hard time around the holidays, but it wasn't too bad, just had to adjust a few things.

 I find people in the community supportive of neighbours, and of where I work (nurse in hospital and community).

I think for the most part people are just tired, they don't necessarily need to have their lives back exactly as they were (to me the expression ""when COVID ends"" has been said way too much, and I always assumed it would last a couple years), but people want to not have to think about every trip or interaction they make.

The support of frontline workers is less obvious, but in individual interactions it still comes through.

 Many people from my neighbourhood groups have asked about my homeless clients more often, and seem to be actively donating a little more."

Because of a few show-boating, ill-informed, and some downright stupid officials blocking the way for relief."
6,journal-entry-9945," In the active adult community where I live, I have seen so many kind acts of compassion this past year. At the beginning of the pandemic, I think most neighbors felt vulnerable, as we were told the virus was deadly for older adults. Daily routines were disrupted and a period of watching & waiting took it’s place. No one had been living through a pandemic before-there were no rules to follow! After the initial shock wore off, there were those who remained cautious and those who decided to resume their former lifestyle. It seems to me that most people did not judge another’s decision. And as friends & neighbors got sick from the virus, meals were delivered, dogs were walked, errands were run and calls and cards were sent and gratefully received."
7,journal-entry-9964," According to my internal counter, it's day 355 of the pandemic and there are some signs of returning to normalcy. But, returning to normalcy is filled with anxiety for me. I've wanted for so long to do normal things like go to a concert or just the neighborhood bar or sit INSIDE a restaurant for dinner - the thought that these things are possible now fill me with dread. This past week there were multiple announcements - the lifting the of the mask mandate in Texas, Eater LA indicating that indoor dining may begin as early as next week in Los Angeles and Disneyland reopening next month. I should be happy, I should be thrilled. Those are all signs of a NORMAL life. But I'm not. I'm terrified in fact. I am nervous of re-entering society - entering a world that I may not even know what it looks like it anymore. Especially as an unvaccinated person. I look at the world so differently now. I feel distrust of others and what they do in their life. Take for example today - I went out for brunch with two friends. I usually love people watching but while sitting at the restaurant, all I could think about was my proximity with the next person and if they already had coronavirus. I hate being that person. Yet here I find myself.

Perhaps I'm struggling the most with the fact that  the very same politicians who blew my life up last year - the ones who told me that I shouldn't be closer than six feet, that I should wear a mask and I should not go see loved ones for the holidays are now telling me it's okay to go to a theme park or fly on an airplane or sit inside a restaurant. To be honest, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it.

Why is right now different? What has fundamentally changed in the last sixty days to make this permissible?  How is today, Saturday, March 6th safer than January 6th?

 I worry that decisions being made right now are political ones, not public health ones. And I worry that the fallout from these decisions will be horrific. That's the problem with hope - it can be so easily taken away - case in point is 2020."

She was prescribed dementia medication which improved her memory some that she remembered two young boys (my younger sons who were the left in my parents' care for three months many moons ago - they are now grown adults) and expressed her anxiety with concern about what to do if something happened to them because they were left behind.

 I requested my close friends and extended family to pray for the recovery of my mother. Prayers for the health care workers taking care of her were included.

 I am very grateful for the presence of the internet and social media as it allows me to keep in touch with family and friends around the world without outrageous expense.

I am very thankful for friends who said prayers or offered a mass for my mother.

11,journal-entry-9857," It feel good to write things down. I like the idea that I'll be able to have a record of all the thoughts I've recorded. Since 700+ people are doing this project here will be quite a range of stories recorded.

 I'd like to mention the five people I know that have died of COVID-19. THe first was my aunt. We weren't close. I had not seen her in 10 years.

The second was my favorite English teacher. He was in his 80s and living in an Assisted Living complex. The memorial service for him was on a SAturday so I didn't tune in live. I listened to it later, but I was glad I got to hear it. He had a big influence on me when I was in high school.

The third person I knew that died was in his 70s. HE was the friend of a friend and Russian.

The fourth person I knew that died was the mother of a friend from high school. I saw her mom quite a few times.

THe last person I know of that died was in his 80s. HE was my former sister-in-law's uncle and his son is a good friend of my sister. I had known him for a long time. HE lived in an assisted living complex where a lot of people got COVID and were to sick to respond to treatment."

I'm six months short of the 75-plus cut off, so I missed the initial round. Now that it has opened to 65-plus, I'm competing with a lot more folks for an appointment. It's frustrating to work my way through the initial screening process on the county website only to find all appointments have been filled.

I continue to isolate and limit contact with friends and family. On the upside, I'm feeling productive and motivated to work on personal projects at home.

Even Disneyland is slated to open April 1st. The Governor is under threat of recall for his handling of the virus... closing restaurants, bars, etc. it’s easy to get signatures inCalifornia for a ballot measure; less easy to actually through a democrat out of office.

 In my circle of friends - the early sixties and up crowd, people are being even more cautious u til they get vaccinated. I guess we are getting so close, why blow it?

And the losses of loved ones is also undoubtedly a factor. One I three Americans have lost someone they love and know to the virus. We are one of those."
15,journal-entry-9938," I think that my community is divided. There is a part of the community that is very supportive  of others and that is trying to work to care for people who are struggling during the pandemic. Another portion of my community seems to be in denial that the pandemic is an issue and they do not seem as supportive.

 I have seen many people coming out to volunteer for things like testing and vaccination drives and there have been many fundraisers and drives to donate to local charities. Early on in the pandemic one of my favorite local restaurants was closed but held an event where you could purchase groceries from them that were originally intended to be part of their menu. You could donate to a fund to make grocery deliveries to families in need. They were also selling things like hand sanitizer made by a local distillery. This restaurant uses a lot of local farms and producers for their menu so I was pleased to support the business and in turn support all of those other local businesses. There have been a number of fundraisers similar to this throughout the community. In addition, in my school community, one member of another class lost her house in a fire and we all donated money and supplies to furnish her new apartment. There have been a number of events like this and I have tried to give where I was able. I felt that a lot of these activities happened in the spring and summer when things were more uncertain.

Recently I have noticed that a large portion of my community seems indifferent to their impact on others and willfully ignores that pandemic.  They continue to eat out at restaurants and refuse to wear masks. I know that these people may have many reasons for doing these things but they are directly impacting others in their community. When they go to a restaurant they are at risk of getting or transmitting coronavirus. The restaurant workers are there because they have to work, and they are being exposed to all of these people who just can't seem to stay home. Then again, not everyone has a kitchen or a good way to eat at home and for some people going to a restaurant may be an essential part of their human contact for the week.

 It is difficult to judge someone for going out at this point because I can't imagine how hard it would be to hardly leave your house for a year. I have felt lucky in some ways that I am in a program that gives me a reason to talk to people and to go out in public. At other times I have felt anxious about being around people and about the risk to myself and to others."

 WOW! What a week. On March 2, the same day that the Texans started their fight against Mexican General Santa Ana, we were granted out freedom by Governor Greg Abbott. We can now decide for ourselves whether or not we will wear masks in this state.

 I am personally torn. I know that the government has the right to make laws that promote the general welfare, and I have always viewed the pandemic edicts as this type of action on the part of the government. But I like my fellow humans, and I love my neighbors. I also like what I can do when I am healthy. And I don’t want to die. With work that brings me into contact with a wide swath of the local populace, I don’t see a problem with wearing a mask when required. But I also felt threatened with severe penalties if I forgot a mask or otherwise slipped in my caution. I am relieved to see that the government is now back into a more benevolent stance."

21,journal-entry-9898," As a professor, I am asked to make my schedule one year in advance. Seriously? Who the heck knows what childcare, teaching/virtual teaching, social distancing, etc will look like in a year AND I'm supposed to plan?

I'm sitting here at 10 pm...in bed typing this because...well, I'm tired of never having time to do something that I want to do. I learned of this project yesterday when I rushed out the door to take my massively moody 2.5 year old and 7 month old on a ride to get them to nap. On the ride, I ""treated"" myself to a little NPR and this is where I found out about this project. I've wondered for a year now how other people are doing but have not known. I teach communication studies and ironically...I have not been able to communicate very much with others. I've taken the pandemic very seriously...first, as a pregnant woman in her late thirties with a 2 year old and now as a mother of two very small children. I continuously wonder...what are people doing? why don't they call? or text? Am I in the minority for profusely using grocery pickups?

Anyways...getting back to the original question. How is the pandemic affecting my life right now? It's making me very tired. This week I got my second vaccine shot. I was blessed in receiving a shot as an educator. This week, I've struggled with aches and pains from the shot. I've also struggled with fatigue and a cranky toddler. I had to ask my husband to stay at home the day after the shot to take care of the kids. I didn't feel guilty. I mean two pregnancies, a pinched nerve, and pandemic later and I FINALLY got a day off to not take care of the kids! It's too bad I was sick! Man, society really has no mercy for women, does it?

 Today, we had some sunshine so we walked and biked and I convinced my toddler to ride in the stroller so I could talk to a colleague from work about work related stuff. The call was probably only about 15% work and the rest was catching up. He's an old friend and we really hadn't talked much on a personal level in several years. The chat about other things other than work was refreshing.  I NEVER get to do that anymore. I'm full-time daycare and full-time professor. When would I have time for a ""social"" life?!?!? I felt he also enjoyed it too. Which left me after the conversation saying, ""I bet he is a little lonely and our chat about takeout Indian food was refreshing break in the monotonous day of teaching and grading inside his home!"""

I am also super grateful for our healthcare system working so well. Last Friday my Dad had knee surgery and this Friday my husband had a colonoscopy. My mom is getting her cateracts fixed soon too.

 My boyfriend and I want to get married, but we are waiting for him to get a job. He has been unemployed for a whole year. Thankfully he is living rent free with family and has his immediate needs cared for, but it has been a frustrating situation for us both.

 I am working from home, but I had to go to the office today to print off paperwork to mail out. Unfortunately, the postage machine was broken, which meant that I had to come back home to mail out the documents. Something as simple as mailing something out becomes a huge hassle.

I haven't been sleeping well for the past two weeks or so, but it's hard to parse out what is depression, and what is work stress, and what is my  continued COVID recovery, and what is what I call ""COVID-depression,"" which is the mental state that we as a society are finding ourselves in.

Además, para mí es importante saber que alguien me lee, que alguien se toma el tiempo de leer cómo estoy, lo que me ha ocurrido. Si lo publican, me alegra que otros lo lean. Al mismo tiempo, yo leo a otros y me doy cuenta de lo diferentes que son las vivencias según las culturas, las sociedades y las economías en que cada quien vive.

 También es importante para mí que este diario está quedando guardado o archivado en la universidad.

1,journal-entry-9749," I was diagnosed with breast cancer on April 28, 2020. I am an international marketing executive at a major Hollywood studio and travel was a big part of my work-life before the pandemic. I was in London the week before lockdown with colleagues from across Europe and Latin America. I landed on a Saturday and was driving to work on Monday when HR called me and told me to turn around, I was quarantined. I went back to work the next day and by Friday we were all told to work from home indefinitely. That was a year ago.

 My children were 2 and 5 when the pandemic started. My oldest son finished pre-school virtually and started Kindergarten virtually. His first day of ""in person"" school was this week (March 1st, 2021).

 I went through chemo in the summer of 2020. I worked part-time virtually. We didn't have child care because we couldn't risk having someone come into our home.  So friends helped us, they played with the kids outside sometimes when I was feeling particularly terrible. My husband did a lot, too. Friends brought gifts, meals and support but no hugs, no chemo partners, I did it all on my own.

 Our friends came down from Portland, took COVID tests and quarantined for 2 weeks with us (and their 2 year old) so they could help during my surgery in October. It turned into 3 surgeries in October and November until they finally got all of the cancer. Then radiation was over the holidays; was burned terribly but at least we had Christmas in our driveway with masks with my husband's family. And a bouncy house for the kids. :). Thank goodness we live in Los Angeles, the weather is nice all the time so no one ever needs to come inside unless they are wearing a mask and need to use the restroom.

We couldn't find antibacterial wipes or toilet paper or paper towels when this started. That's eased up now thankfully. We were worried about diapers and wipes, and food for the kids, but none of that came to be. We ordered toys from Amazon, groceries from Instacart, food delivery from UberEats.

We take the kids to the playground now. And the zoo and aquarium. We feel like we know what to do to stay safe--always with masks, always outside, always with hand washing and sanitizing. It's normal now.

 I started a daily journal with photos and screenshots of the WHO website when the pandemic started. 1,000 cases worldwide, then 2,000. I never thought we'd be more than a million, more than 250,000 dead. That journal stopped in April with breast cancer; I had much more to worry about and I guess that's been a blessing.

 I'm a different person now than I was before. I eat well and exercise. I'm present for my children and not on the road. We have lunch and dinner together every day. We have a babysitter when my husband and I need to work. We've seen the worst of it hopefully.

My parents lived with us until October 2019 and then they moved back to St. Louis. They were with my kids every day since they were born and now haven't seen them in more than a year. It's hard for them but they just got their first vaccine shot yesterday. Because of the cancer, I can get mine in another 2 weeks.

 I'm excited for life to get back to some version of normal but I really hope it's not the old normal. It wasn't working for any of us. I want to hold on to a lot of this new life, even when COVID is a distant memory."

If they get it, and they get really sick, it will take time to make arrangements for someone to take care of my daughter so that I can go (drive 2 days? Risk flying????) visit them or take care of them. Worst case scenario, I don’t want our last words before intubation (or worse.....) to be us yelling at each other. I guess I don’t know if not having any last words at all would make me feel better. I hope I don’t have to find out."

People are hungry and I see donations to the food bank increase. The online disaster of securing a vaccine appointment is spread around the country. Locally a young man set up a vaccine appointment tracking website to help others locate open appointments. His story made the local news and when people found out this man set up the site on his own using his own money donations began pouring in to help him maintain his website.Neighbors will stop their cars, roll down their windows and ask if you need anything at the store. I have seen and experienced such acts of kindness."
4,journal-entry-9698,"This is my first entry. I heard about this project on NPR this morning, and was prompted to seek this out because I've been surprised that I haven't done a better job of writing down and processing all that we, and I, have experienced this past pandemic year. In my daily calendar for 2020 I marked the date when Portland went into lock down last March, and how I assumed that everyone would hunker down and we'd get through the crisis in a weeks, months at most. My daughter was supposed to get married in September 2020, and as she was fretting about whether they should cancel their venue, caterer, and DJ, I remember urging her to give it a little time, and that ""if we're still experiencing the virus in September, then our problems are much bigger than having to postpone a wedding."" Well, here we are. The wedding has been rescheduled for October 2021, and I think it will happen this time.

In spite of everything,  my family has been so lucky. We've remained employed, haven't been sick. My husband and I still enjoy each other's company! But god i miss people. Last night I had another dream about being at a big party, kissing and hugging. And feelings of people no longer wanting to be my friends creep in as scheduling outside time has just become too hard. We're all so sick of it. One friend of mine has sequestered himself even harder because he refuses to let his guard down now, not when we're all so close to being able to get the vaccination.

I'm ending this now to do homework and get ready for zoom class. Thank god I've had new studies, an interesting outside volunteer gig, and part-time work to keep me tethered to the weird passage of time."
5,journal-entry-9750," My children are 6 and 3 now and they've spent the last year in quarantine. I think they're much better off today than they were a year ago in some ways. And not in other ways.

Both of my kids were over-booked and they weren't on any sports teams, didn't have any lessons, etc. We just did stuff with them all the time. The playplace, the park, a restaurant, the zoo, the farm, we just went places. All the time. And they just wanted to be at home.

My youngest son doesn't remember pre-pandemic but he used to cry to stay home. Now when we're out he cries if we're going home. He loves seeing the world; it fascinates him.

My oldest son loves his house now, too--even while he's been doing virtual Kindergarten for a year. He likes snack time and recess playing with his brother. He gets video game time only on the weekends after he's finished all of his chores for the week on his chore chart. He doesn't complain; he's a very happy kid.

 I worry about so many children out there who are at risk, so vulnerable because their parents are abusive, or maybe they're neglected, the parents are working out of the home or stressed over money. We are safe and secure. I have a good job and it's been stable. I often think we had an upside-down pandemic. We became closer as a family, we became better and more present parents, we learned and loved more than before."

8,journal-entry-5845," Esta semana he de decir que estoy muy agradecida con aquellas mujeres que tienen poder y usan ese poder para ayudar a otras mujeres. Realmente no hubiera podido sobrevivir a la pandemia si una de ellas no hubiera tomado cartas en el asunto.  Buscó la forma de darme trabajo y gracias a ello, logré sobrevivir. Luego, otra de ellas, me dio trabajo en octubre y noviembre. Esto me ha permitido tener un fin de año con necesidades básicas cubiertas. Estoy muy agradecida con estas mujeres que deciden usar su poder de forma asertiva y generosa.

Cuando estuve pensando en esto, recordé que mi mamá también recibió ayuda de mujeres que usan su poder para respaldar a otras mujeres. Gracias a esa ayuda, mi mamá logró sacarnos adelante a mí y a mi hermano. I. le enseñó a dar clases, le dio trabajo y la recomendó en colegios donde ella también trabajaba. Mi mamá se había separado de mi padre, este no la ayudaba económicamente, así que ella tenía que mantener el hogar. También, V., la recomendó para trabajar en otros colegios y cuando llegó el momento de retirarse, la apoyó para que recibiera la compensación económica que le correspondía. I. murió de un cáncer hace muchos años.

 En mi vida también he conocido mujeres que buscan destruir a otras mujeres. Es más, lo he vivido en carne propia. Pero realmente, si reviso mi vida, han sido más las mujeres que me han ayudado y con las que encuentro formas de trabajar en conjunto de manera satisfactoria. Y en definitiva, en estos tiempos de pandemia, tenerlas de mi lado ha sido un gran regalo. Muchas gracias a todas ellas."

13,journal-entry-8927,"El otro día fui a ayudar a un amigo de la familia a recoger unos muebles para llevar a su casa. Nos tomó toda la mañana el ejercicio.  El mundo se veía raro, tenía la impresión -quizá por la nieve y el silencio- de que estaba desplazándome por la escena de una película vieja. 

Cuando llegamos a la casa donde teníamos que recoger los muebles, saludé a la dueña de casa, siempre desde lejos y me quedé mirando los muebles que había que mover.  Algo en mí quería terminar todo rápidamente para volver a casa. El encierro me está llegando a las fibras y empiezo a temer, pero no es el miedo convencional de quien espera el peligro, sino el miedo constante de quién se sabe acechado. Incluso las conversaciones fueron forzosas. No soy alguien que conversa mucho, no por voluntad, pero esta vez había algo que me hacía sentir incómodo de hablar, una urgencia rara de quien hace un trámite desagradable. En cambio, el frío de la calle vacía, me devolvía el alma al cuerpo y me ayudaba a continuar con los viajes.

Entre un punto y otro, la carretera me trajo el recuerdo del primer viaje en carretera que hice en el país, desde el Kennedy en Nueva York hasta la casa en la que, de hecho, estoy viviendo nuevamente. Había un aire nuevo en todo, pero también monotonía, una monotonía ajena que me invadía y extendía, en alguna medida, la monotonía del encierro.  Parece ser que esta cuarentena forzosa y larguísima (por no decir eterna) ha empezado intervenir cada aspecto de nuestras vidas, o al menos de la mía. "

16,journal-entry-9473," A significant issue I have dealt with this week has to do with if and when I can sign jus for a vaccination appointment.

I havd not mentioned previously that I Ama cancer patient. I was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer in November - discovered accidentally in the investigation of another issue.

Since then I have undergone a program of radiation which concluded, after 6 weeks of treatment, about three weeks ago. I have also had a program of chemotherapy consisting of four treatments every three weeks. My fourth treatment is scheduled for next week and will occur dependent on what my blood component levels are at the time.

 Because of this vulnerability of a compromised immune system, I was hopeful of getting the vaccine.

but........in conference with the oncologist, he has advised that I should wait a few weeks after the ""cycle"" of my last infusion. It is important that my system - i.e. my blood counts - are strong enough to present an effective response to the vaccine.

So............ I understand this and accept his advice, but am disappointed that I will go another 6 or so weeks in the same state of vulnerability in which I have been for virtually the past year.

 I feel like I'm on the fringe of the wave of vaccinated and revitalized citizens!"
17,journal-entry-9225," After weeks of fruitless efforts, I finally got an appointment for my husband to get his first dose of vaccine for this week. It's such a relief to know that he will finally be protected. I'm still not officially eligible, however a friend of mine told me yesterday about a site where a local hospital system is registering people 50+ years old. So I immediately signed up. It wasn't clear how long it will be before they contact me to make an appointment, but I hope it's soon.

 My brother called yesterday and asked if he can come to visit and stay for a couple days. He lives about 2 hours away from us. He will be arriving tomorrow. Since the pandemic began I've only seen him maybe 3 times. He's come over to visit for an hour or two and we always sat outside. This time he will be staying overnight and as much as I want to see him for a longer visit I""m also worried. He will be in the house with us, eating and hanging around. We obviously can't sit outside the whole time. We can wear masks inside and I think the weather will be suitable for having windows open. Even so, there is risk and it scares me since my husband will only be getting his first dose on the day he arrives and of course I won't be vaccinated at all.

 My brother's wife died of COVID in December. She was in a nursing home so it wasn't exactly a surprise, but it was still heart-breaking. Now my brother is alone. His sister-in-law lives about 30 minutes away from him and they are close. But I worry about him being alone. I wish he would move back home close to me and my sister and other brother. We're the only ones left in my family and I'd like us all to be close together."

I have found that my life is so routine that I don't feel the passage of time. There are not celebrations (public or private) or events to mark the passage of time. I seems like all of a sudden a year has gone by and I have no idea what I did during that time."
20,journal-entry-9181," He was gaining footing, getting jobs and feeling proud of the work he was doing. His business was thriving and I was so proud. But COVID had a different plan. It made it unsafe for him to go into strangers' houses and do work on their properties. It made it unsafe to go to Home Depot and buy supplies, It robbed him of his motivation, his excitement, his skills.

 For a while he kept himself busy with little home improvement projects. Making a pegboard, re-laying the bathroom floor, and carving measuring spoons out of walnut and maple wood. Then the depression and restlessness set in. As did the cold weather. Stuck inside with no end in sight, he applied for unemployment. He'll be on unemployement at least through April. And then what? He likely will never go back to his small business or the clients he amassed. Hopefully it'll be a meaningful change.  Hopefully we'll all get those meaningful changes we're yearning for."

This is discouraging, as my husband and I contemplate retirement. I go in to work 3 days a week, working remotely otherwise, and to the drugstore to pick up prescriptions - that's it. Tiresome and repetitive. I have worked to expand the time I spend reading books, and have begun to journal again after a long absence. This helps."
22,journal-entry-9106," I was born during Polish “Stan wojenny” state of war period in early 80s when strict curfew was imposed. Now I find myself again in a country with strict curfew rules. For over a month now everyone in Quebec is forbidden to leave their house between 8pm and 5am. It’s not like I have anywhere to go, especially being a mom of 10 months old, but can’t shake off feeling imprisoned. I feel our apartment door locking. We are safe here. We have a full fridge, good wifi and uber eats on speed dial. And I still feel so trapped. My partner says even without the pandemic we would be stuck at home with the baby anyways, that our life would still be a lockdown. But he is a loner, who rarely meets up with any of his few friends. I used to have a big group of female friends around me, friends that could be visiting me now, bringing wine, much needed help with childcare and just good company. Instead we both stare at their respective screen: him overworking himself so he can keep his well paying, cushy tech job, me escaping my motherly duties to the world of pre-pandemic Law and Order. I tried to watch the “pandemic” season once - could not sleep for few days. If it’s real in Law and Order, it’s real everywhere.

25,journal-entry-9090," This week I had an email disagreement with my boss over the safety issues involved in reopening my work-place to the publc. Because he (my boss) is an administrator and not working on-the-ground with patrons and I am, I thought it was important to express my concerns about things in the past (when we were open during our county's red tier) that made me afraid of being in the building: non-complaince of mask-wearing by patrons and employees, and eating/food (since folks have to take off their masks to eat and aerosol seems to be the main form of covid transmission). These are things I see, and my immediate coworkers, but that my boss does not see because he is not part of the daily working of the library.

 Honestly, my email was kind of blunt because I can't believe I am having to make these points now that we are almost a year into the pandemic. My boss was ticked off in his response - he told me all protocols would be followed just as they had been (which of course, they weren't) and that because I am not a frontline employee, I can just stay home and come in after hours for work needs, AND, that because I have been vaccinated I shouldn't be worrying so much.

I like my boss but every now and then, when I bring something like this to his attention, he gets kind of angry at me. Makes me feel like an unneeded part of the organization. I know we will get through this latest disagreement but I think that the way it will dissipate is by me not bringing it up again, or pressing my point."
1,journal-entry-9096," This week was my son’s third birthday. Instead of a party or a special outing we had cake and presents and bbqed outside since it was unseasonably warm. One set of his grandparents are now fully vaccinated so they came over for a little while (still outside only, still in masks). We had many FaceTime calls throughout the evening: the other grandparents, cousins, friends. My son was thrilled. And I realized he doesn’t even know a world where friends come over to houses or where kids ride carousels. Just his two of his grandparents stopping by was over the top amazing for him.

This comfort of his with this pandemic life is both hugely helpful and a bit devastating for me. When we go hiking on the weekends, he runs to the side of the trail when we run into other hikers, he reminds me to “Give the people space, mommy”. When we pick up books at the library, he looks in through the glass, not wistfully as he did a year ago, but practically to see what he might want to order for next time. He doesn’t even remember going inside anymore. Words like “mask”, “curbside pickup” and “sanitizer” are part of his daily vocabulary. Covid life is the only life he knows."

 It never snows where I live. We may go years between snow showers that last maybe overnight. But this year, we were shut down across all 254 counties in the state for at least two or three days with snow and icy road conditions. Northern counties were shut down for up to a week. It has been a big deal in the news, and it has eclipsed a larger story. The COVID pandemic is abating. After another week of lockdown enforced by nature and a vaccination drive, the numbers are down. Some businesses in my area not only got relief from the return to warm spring weather, they are now allowed to return to 75% occupancy rates. Most businesses in my area have not seen this level since the pandemic lockdowns last year."
6,journal-entry-8768," This week I was able to get my Corona virus vaccine shot. Under Massachusetts' companion program I was able to take my mother-in-law for her second shot (I also took her to her first before the program started) and get my first.  Registering for the shot felt both like a cruel game and winning the lottery. Our experience at the Mass Vaccination Site was incredible! It was smoothly run and all of the staff we interacted with were great!

 My husband got his shot as he has multiple co-morbidities and I feel incredibly relieved that we are both scheduled for our second and that maybe when we are able to reopen our restaurant it will be a little safer for each of us personally. The flip side to this is that I am a 36 year old white woman. I was able to use my computer and cell phone to snag these spots. Talk about privilege. So much of this pandemic has been a study in contrasts, our business has been forced to close, when we are open things are so hard!! But we have our home and plenty of food and are safe.

With the vaccine appointments, I am home with my daughter and have the ability to get online as soon as appointments open up. In fact, I am going to try and help another ""grandma"" in our family register for her shot tomorrow. So I guess I am using the privilege well but I am still so conflicted. Like I shouldn't have gotten a vaccine because others need it, the system was set up for me to be successful from the bottom up. Ugh ... am I a shitty person for wanting to protect myself and my family and my staff? Maybe."
7,journal-entry-6190," Hace frío. -5 grados centígrados afuera. 10 grados aquí en casa.  Ya es de madrugada y aún no tengo sueño, pero debo hacer el propósito de dormir o por lo menos acostarme para descansar. Aunque hoy me levanté muy tarde, casi a medio día. El horario se me ha cambiado y no sé qué es lo que lo ha trastornado. Quizás el frío. Le echo la culpa al frío de todos mis males. Pero en realidad no sé qué es lo que está pasando. Qué más da. Mañana – o más tarde- será otro día. Un mejor día.

 Entre hoy y ayer han estado llegando a diferentes países de Sudamérica la vacuna contra la peste. La mejor vacuna hasta ahora es la diseñada por los rusos, llamada Sputnik V, con una eficacia de más del 96%.  He visto en el canal de YouTube de la rusa Inna Afinogenova – a quien le creo por lo juiciosas que investigando- que la comunidad científica unió esfuerzos y ya están combinando tanto la vacuna rusa como las versiones europeas. Hoy empezó la vacunación al personal de la salud en Chile. El presidente en persona fue a recibir las primeras vacunas. También llegaron a la Argentina las primeras 300 mil vacunas Sputnik V.

 Y a Colombia no ha llegado ni mierda.   No se sabe cómo se hizo la contratación de las vacunas y a qué precio salieron y ya el congreso está llamando a control político al ministro de salud. Dicen que compraron 40 millones pero no dicen a qué precio y cómo fueron las negociaciones. Además compraron las que menos eficacia tienen, es decir, compraron lo peor.  Aquí en gringolandia ya comenzaron también una primera etapa de vacunación.  Mañana 28 vacunan a mi prima L. que trabaja en una clínica donde hay muchas personas infectadas."
8,journal-entry-8798,"First a comment concerning the questions that preceded this week's question. I am from Canada,  so my responses relate to my experiences in Canada. Healthcare here is something we all have without concern for cost with very few exceptions. If someone wanted to change our health care this is ""a mountain I would die on.""I also feel that I can trust my elected officials and the media to a greater extent than if I were to live in the United States. I watch American news, and it is different from here. Some American news can get my blood pressure up quickly

The pandemic affected me this week in a few ways. First my wife is continually commenting on the lack of vaccines in Canada compared to the US. We have no production facilities which makes us lower on the list than countries that produce their own. The result is fewer people being vaccinated compared to the US which does not sit well with her. I try not to dwell on it as there is nothing I can do that will change the situation. I find the comments and comparison somewhat annoying, but I let her know I hear her.

A highlight was I able to ski this week which gave me a break from the monotony of isolating for most of the time. Walking in the community was back in my routine after a few weeks off with an injury. It was nice to see the doctor a few weeks back and be told that the injury would heal but would take time. It has healed so my concerns gone.

I do not often think about getting Covid-19 even though it is a possibility. In our community there have been a few minor outbreaks but nothing connected to anyone I know or associate with. I did see someone this week without a mask on in Costco. I was going to say something but decided not to as I did want her shouting at me without a mask. This is the first time I have witnessed this since the spring.

 I miss contact with our family and not having them over for dinners and visits. Not being able to do things with our grandchildren I miss very much. I also miss being able to crouch down and talk to younger children who are out walking with their parents or grandparents. Young children when they smile perhaps say something can really make my day.

 I dream most nights and often they are nightmares. Regardless of the type of dream, good or bad, I cannot remember the dream within seconds of waking up. I think my dreams have changed over the past year, and perhaps it is related to the pandemic, but I am not sure. I don't seem to dream about the pandemic, at least that I can recall. Likewise, I try to avoid social media and much of the news as there is little that is new, and I feel much of the information isn't based on facts but opinions. Negativity is something I try to avoid social media and many news sources are a great place to find it. I, like most people am just tired of doing so few things that were a part of my life.  I am simply tired but will continue to do what is asked of me. I feel like we will make it and patience is a virtue."

Fortunately I am a PT so I am able to stretch and do what I need to do to take care of my body. Also just need to mention “maskne” or mask acne. I’m 26 and have pimples all over my chin.. but the mask covers it so maybe it doesn’t matter. I’m also thirsty. I work in an environment where I don’t get many breaks and don’t drink a lot of water under normal circumstances. Masks have made this infinitely more challenging. I’m dehydrated and tired.

10,journal-entry-5870,"We are trying to buy a house right now, and one that we loved, in a neighbourhood we love came on the market the day before quarantine began. We live in an incredibly hot housing market where all listings state an 'offer date' so they can accumulate many offers at the same time. This listing said that they would accept pre-emptive offers (which are usually without conditions and very high priced). We went straight to the bank to get a bank draft for a deposit (required with offers where we live) and made an offer that night that expired the next day, since we wouldn't be able to make the bank trips on their stated offer date. They declined our offer, choosing to wait until offer day to have more choices. I am sad because the pandemic and our quarantine responsibilities really hurt our chances to buy a home that we loved.

Since then, I haven't left our house and I probably won't other than the occasional walk around the neighbourhood for a couple of weeks. Mostly, life is a little boring and lonesome right now."

I've bonded with the park and my neighborhood in a way that I never had prior to this pandemic. I feel more grounded to the place I live and am now more observant of everything around me than before when I used to rush around back and forth from the office and spending so much time underground in the subway.

15,journal-entry-8735,"The thing I am maddest about is what I've been mad about since this thing began. I'm 62 years old and  trying to make the most out of the health and vitality I have left. I took my first plane ride at the end of 2019 and was ready to begin a new phase of life. A phase of not holding back. Not being afraid to have fun. I was ready to see new places, ride taller roller coasters. Have as much fun as I can, while I can. But COVID hit the pause button. It stole what might have been the best year out of the years I have left. I will never be younger than I am right now. I can never get that back. And I am afraid that some of my new found bravery might be gone, too.  I long for spring to throw the lid off of this damned box. Let me OUT!"
16,journal-entry-8544," My dog has cancer and I haven't really told that many people, mostly because it feels weird to reach out and have it be the main reason you are reaching out. If I was seeing people regularly, I would be able to tell them as a normal part of our interaction, but now it is a whole thing to share information.

 I have also been eating a lot out of boredom and frustration. My job is boring, but I don't want to get another one because I am able to work at home. I am frustrated a lot just in general. I have noticed myself wishing I was hungry more often that way I would be able to eat and have something to do. I know I've gained weight, and although it is a little stressful, I am mostly just seeing it as my body and mind adapting to this situation of not being able to do much. I don't think I would be able to handle the uncomfortable feelings of being at home all the time without food, so thank you food!

 The weather is a lot nicer this week too,so I've been able to go outside and just enjoy the immenseness of the sky and nature. That has been uplifting to me. I am really glad I have a backyard so I'm able to do this."

18,journal-entry-8223,"Pareciera que nada existe antes de este estado de encierro. Las relaciones sociales, los viajes, incluso los trámites indeseables, parecen haber sido completamente borrados del espectro de la rutina.   Ya no hay rutina, de hecho, solamente este ir y venir de un día al otro, casi como un ensayo,  siempre con la tensión de lo impredecible acumulándose en el pellejo, en las acciones que cada uno ejecuta, en las cosas simples (como salir por el correo) o en las más complejas interacciones (como ir a una visita médica), no hay nada más que una tensión que crece.

 Más que la noción del tiempo, en estos días (idea que titila o se mueve como un espejismo en el horizonte de la percepción) he ido perdiendo la idea de pausa.  Todo parece estar formando parte de una pausa, una suspensión no sólo del tiempo, sino del movimiento del mundo. Tengo la sensación de estar oyendo el mundo girar, porque todo se ha detenido a tal punto, que uno puede escuchar la propia respiración acompasándose a los movimientos.  Incluso en los lugares más ruidosos, hay algo que falta. Al mismo tiempo, pienso en lo frenético de las bodegas de Amazon, donde nadie se protege lo suficiente, nadie gana lo suficiente, nadie puede pensar lo suficiente para organizarse. Difícilmente, alguien de las bodegas podría decir que el mundo se ha detenido, pero esa misma acentuación de su movimiento es producto de la parálisis total de la sociedad.

Sobre la parálisis, puedo decir algunas cosas: he dejado de ver gente, he empezado a lidiar conmigo mismo, he empezado a recuperar mi capacidad de lectura. En suma, el giro copernicano -desagradable, imagino, para muchos- del mundo es llegar a darse cuenta de que el problema podría ser uno mismo y la suma de las partes. Sueño con el día en que la gente descubra que la estructura a la que tanto culpan, a esa maquinaria descorazonada que maldicen, es en realidad la suma de las voluntades sometidas. En el fondo, quiero que todo arda y se refórmale, cosa que no pasará de manera global, no al menos cuando esté vivo.

Por lo mismo, no sé si cambiará el sentido de las cosas después de haberse torcido como hasta ahora.  Han cambiado muchas cosas, pero en términos muy sutiles como para soportar, y de soportar es que uno va armando las costumbres en las que se acomoda y, finalmente, se endurece hasta la indiferencia. Habrá que ver cómo encuentran la luz las futuras generaciones."
19,journal-entry-8222," El sector artístico y de espectáculos ha sido uno de los más afectados durante la pandemia. También debo decir que antes de la pandemia, yo no salía mucho, ni asistía a muchos espectáculos.

 Lo que he observado es que han tratado de migrar al ámbito virtual. Han hecho el esfuerzo de proponer obras de teatro, conciertos por medio digitales, pero creo que los resultados no se comparan ni lejanamente con las presentaciones presenciales.

Algunos han tenido que buscar espacios amplios para presentar sus espectáculos y rezar para que no llueva. Es la única forma, porque los teatros quedan muy cerrados.

Para mí, la diversión se limita a ver televisión, algún espectáculo que me interese en alguna red social, retomar libros que no he leído y no más."

2,journal-entry-8358,"So I'm doing my master's in biochemistry, and right now it feels like my studies are on hold while labs aren't taking students to do lab rotations. I have a job doing PCR-based Covid tests one shift a week, pipetting samples for DNA extraction and such. I started in November and December and January were crazy, with our lab doing almost a thousand tests a day. At the moment it's much less, and we only do a few hundred (probably around 300 or so). I'm glad I have that job at least, because all my lectures are online now and otherwise I'm mostly just at home- in my 17 m^2 room. It's tiny, and very lonely. Going to the grocery store is basically the highlight of my day.

But I saw a friend last Sunday for the first time in weeks, we got bubble tea and went for a walk around the city. I miss spending more time with my friends. I moved to this city to study here in October 2019, and I really tried to meet new people and be more sociable, going to the queer student's group and trying to make friends with fellow biochem students. Now it's all so much harder and I feel so alone all the time and stressed with exams coming up. I really miss studying in the university library. I know I still have it easy and things aren't that bad for me but it still feels difficult. I even miss train rides...

Every day I look up the numbers of new infections and vaccinations. If new infections are going down things feel okay, but lately they've been going back up and I'm so scared things are just going to get worse. And looking at the vaccine statistics is frustrating, what with how slowly it seems to be happening. At work people have said we can get vaccinated, but since I don't have direct contact with infectious material I don't want to get it before I'm actually supposed to. I know that it's important for everyone who is mediacally vulnerable, who has a lot of contacts, or who is working with patients to get it first and I don't want to use some loophole to get vaccinated before my turn just because I can.

But to end on a positive note: Today it was warm and sunny and I went outside to study my flashcards and there were so many people going on walks, children playing on playgrounds and people walking their dogs. It's easy to feel isolated and alone in my room, but there's something about hearing kids laughing and birds singing that makes things better. It reminds you that life is still going and things haven't stopped, even if it feels like it."
3,journal-entry-8351," This is the 17th day of being flat on a bed, mine or hospital. I'm home now, supposedly better but walking across three rooms of the house brings on fits of gasping for air. I didn't need to be - and here's another thing, I just forgot the word where you're intubated with an air hose - it didn't get to that point.

 When I went to the emergency room I hadn't had anything to eat in six days. My mind was (and remains) a mess. They asked me if I'd had a bowel movement lately and I stalled them by replying ""not sure"". I had a vague idea what the process entailed - I pictured valves - and started to Google ""bowel movement"" before I remembered.

 I'm trying to get whatever thought structures I used to employ to work again. It requires air so I sit at my desk for long stretches waiting for enough - what - air pressure to build and a thought to appear?

The worst: I still have nightmares of the food they brought me. They'd set down the tray, I'd uncover and do the big reveal. It would be the opposite of what I ordered and cold when it was supposed to be hot and hot when it was supposed to be cold.

This is nothing though. This is the best of all worlds. My wife just finished Stage 1 breast cancer and I had just gotten back from taking her to her parents in Florida to spend a month recuperating. So she's just had to deal with me long distance away from danger."

I sat in a recliner chair for days and my manual wheelchair wouldn't fit in the narrow hall to the bathroom so I had to walk a lot more than my knees are really capable of. The resulting pain is intense. Thankfully we are back home but the fear of another power outage looms large. My body will take a couple of weeks to recover and I am in another colitis flare, probably from the stress and also limited diet during the outage.

 We also have a vibrant small business community - and so many people have pulled together to support local restaurants and businesses. And the restaurants themselves have been creative in adapting - those who can, of course. Some have not been able to make it work. Many restaurants are feeing those in the community who have been economically undermined by the pandemic, and feeding frontline health workers, as well.

 There is also a new nonprofit that grew out of a grassroots effort to provide basic needs items to people hit hard during the pandemic. Many organizations came together and centralized a donation center, and every week they post what is needed in the community - they know this because they are working with organization who serve vulnerable populations, refugees and immigrants, homeless, etc. So this new nonprofit has become a hub, to coordinate and align donations.

I guess I had a bit to say. I'm grateful I live in a place where, even if we don't know each other directly, there is a feeling of care in the broader community."
8,journal-entry-8168,"February 18, 2021

This week has been wild. The whole state of Texas has been under a weather emergency from Brownsville to Lubbock and El Paso to Beaumont due to ice and snow. At no time in my life can I remember such a prolonged and widespread emergency down here since Saturday night. We have been subjected to  rolling blackouts to deal with unprepared utilities and dwindling fuel supplies. The lack of electricity has caused water systems to go down, as the pumps that fill water towers are electric. It is really bad in my part of the state, as we are completely unused to such weather. Any point south of I10 (which runs from Beaumont to El Paso to Los Angeles) is usually so balmy that people from the northern United States come here upon retirement to enjoy the milder weather.

 This has been a real problem in terms of vaccine distribution. Most hospitals were prepared in terms of staffing, but the electrical supply situation has caught many administrators off guard. The electrical supply has sometimes put vaccine in jeopardy, as it must be kept cold until inoculation of a patient. So, when the vaccine has been threatened, the hospitals and clinics are left doing emergency inoculations of anyone that is available and needs a shot. Some of the hospitals and clinics are even closed, so people who were up for a shot had to reschedule.As for the patients, the roads have been completely impassible for most of this week, so many of them found getting to a clinic or hospital difficult.  The real concern expressed locally is for the people who have had their first shot and need the second shot. No one really knew what would happen when the second shot is delayed."

Our lives used to be filled with friends, activities, travel, and a feeling of freedom. Today, none of this exists. So, how do we want to live today? How can I enrich my life from my home?  I haven't seen my family or my new great niece in 16 months. I miss our time together, and most of all the laughter.

Whenever I'm feeling sad, I listen to these songs and I feel overjoyed. My parents watched Sesame Street when they were little. I still watch the show even though I'm an adult.

16,journal-entry-7452," Dado que el tiempo se suspende - o sea: marcha, pero en una suerte de realidad paralela-, las cosas parecen no ocurrir nunca. De pronto, el fin de semana aparece y parece que uno hubiera vivido diez años en vez de 6 días.  El trabajo, de la misma manera, fluye con la lentitud del fango, pero con la misma fuerza de un río crecido: abruptamente, el tiempo nos golpea y no sabemos qué estamos perdiendo de esta realidad recortada.

También, haciendo caso a la estación,  la nieve ha sido un hito con el cual interrumpimos la penitencia. En las últimas dos semanas, hemos tenido que remover nieve metódicamente, sin pausa, pero sin prisa, cada uno en un rincón de la casa.  Lo hacemos mi suegro y yo, cada uno en su propio silencio. No hay mediaciones, simplemente abrimos la puerta del garage y, luego de agarrar una pala con decisión y desgano (la rara mezcla es posible, aunque excepcional), y arrancamos removiendo lo que, esperamos, sea nieve ligera. Hemos tenido suerte en esa parte, al menos en la última semana.

Y ya que mi salud física está tan apolillada como mi cerebro, el dolor muscular que se extiende por días marca otra penitencia, la del insomnio. Se pierde la claridad del día y la noche, y la cuenta de los días se hace más y más borrosa. De pronto es viernes, o miércoles o sábado. No importa: todos esos días son en el fondo uno solo donde no se puede dormir tranquilo.

 Pareciera que esto no tiene nada que ver con el virus, pero todo está atravesado por él: el tiempo, suspendido en su circunstancia; el trabajo, intangible y sin embargo concreto; la nieve, que removemos sin que nadie transite la calle en nuestro radio inmediato; la salud que, a falta de movimiento, carcome la razón y la convierte -en mi caso- en un relato donde todo se sale de órbita y la realidad, más que un delirio, es un mal viaje."
17,journal-entry-7905," “I was intrigued, because all he wanted was love,” or so he said. “I want love too.”

 West Hollywood, California, the gayest part of Los Angeles, is my home town. I haven’t felt love since March when I started to shelter in place. A lot of guys use websites to meet other men. For me, surfing these websites is kind of like, window shopping. Online, good-looking men hit me up. I message back that I’m looking for one exceptional guy in my life, and I’m not meeting anyone, without a mask and without six feet of separation, until I get the vaccine; it’s a struggle to keep my resolve, but I do.

 The internet is a mixed blessing. There was a time men met in bars, in coffee shops, at gyms, and even on the street, but COVID and online dating sites changed–up, all of that. I have not been touched by man or beast since I started staying at home, almost a year ago. Looking at photos of old boyfriends is not my idea of good-love, but to paraphrase an old rock ‘n roll standard, If it wasn’t for bad-love, if it wasn’t for real-bad-love, I wouldn’t have no love at all.

Sometimes, I haunt these websites, looking for love in all the wrong places. Part of my cyber-cruising is a vestigial remnant of behavior I no longer manifest, and it’s kind of obsessive. I can get stuck on this Loveholic hunt for hours. But I don’t find love. And love does not find me. There is no sweet, chubby, baby cupid firing arrows into MY heart.

Many websites use GPS technology; they tell you exactly how many feet away, each man is from your location. Urban legend: two guys meet on the same Virgin Atlantic flight this way, and fall in love. Really? All these sites are international, although you can break it down to the city you live in – guys are having physical encounters all over the world - COVID be damned. Scary.

These days when you sleep with someone, you sleep with everyone they have slept with, germ-wise. Old friends with benefits call me and want to come by, like there is no raging pandemic, at all. I feel their needs, I understand; I’m needy, too. I have not held someone in my arms. I have not given or taken love. I have not had grand and glorious sex, for far too long and I am going kind of Kovid-Krazy. After all, I am a red-blooded, queer, all-American man, hello?

 COVID makes me realize that I want a guy to call my own. While romantic adventures used to be fun, what I really crave is someone to deeply love who loves me back. I want one special man; I want a boyfriend, a lover, a partner, maybe a husband. I always thought that marriage was a heterosexual construct, but now I am thinking that the pandemic caused a paradigm shift, at least in my thinking. Do you want somebody to love? Yes, I want somebody to love. I need somebody to love. When I write that, silly pop songs flood my brain, but it’s true, why dissemble, that’s what I want.  The whole bit, a ring, a wedding, maybe a child, I want it all.

I met George on Adam4Adam, the oldest gay dating site out there. I wrote, and in my first message told him, that because of COVID, I am sheltering in place and not having physical encounters. I continued, ""I’m looking for someone sweet, manly, and honest, a monogamous lover who could be my best friend."" So was George. We messaged back and forth on A4A. We exchanged phone numbers and started texting. We sent pictures. George is a handsome man; we both have beards and art collections.

Straight off, George called me “darling”, which is a little off-putting. Far too much affection, far too soon, for it to be for real. Then he called me “love”, and added, “My man”. “My man,” was at least masculine. “Darling” and “love” are endearments that need to be earned with time. I started calling him, ""Baby” and “Georgie,” getting into the spirit of things, but not wanting to commit. Texting only goes so far. You can’t take the emotional pulse of someone you want to love, in a text. Finally, we spoke on the phone. What a mess. His cell kept breaking up. George has a thick, impenetrable English accent, which I hope is charming in person, but combined with his phone problem, torpedoed our communication.

I wanted to meet for coffee on the weekend, at Starbucks. But George wasn’t picking up on the idea. So on Saturday, I asked George if he would take a Houseparty video call with me on Sunday at 5:30 pm. George said fine and asked me to send him a link, which I did. He texts me a big red heart Emogi. On Sunday when I didn’t hear from him, I resent the link, three times. No George. “Hey George, are you there? Click on the Houseparty link. Click on the link I sent you.” He didn’t call or text. In the old days, if we had a date and you shredded a flat tire or got sick, at least you called or texted. George did nothing.

Suddenly, a message from Adam4Adam flashed on my PC. “It's Sunday night...the busiest time on A4A, come join us.” Okay, I am going on the website to see if George is on, just curious. A banner cajoles me to “Upgrade to get unlimited message history.” George’s messages are gone and I forgot his screen name. I don’t want to start scrolling through the online members. I get angry, then sad. I guess I should have upgraded.

An instant A4A, alert comes at me. (I forgot to close the browser). Presto, who wants a long-term relationship messages me. I message back. “Hey Presto, Thanks for reaching out, I am looking for a long-term relationship with one guy, but, you’re in Pittsburg and I am in Los Angeles, so you are not the man for me. Good luck finding somebody to love.” I closed the browser. Finding someone to love…is the universal quest… but it ain’t easy.

 COVID changed me up; I’m not the man I used to be. There are lots of good, man-on-man love story movies on all the big streaming sites, from Amazon to Netflix and Youtube, too. Watching them; I get caught up in characters that need romantic love, just like me. These are sweet, steamy love stories. Some have happy endings, like God’s Own Country, others don’t, like Brokeback Mountain. There is a provocative new romantic series, staged in Texas, produced by Rob Lowe, who plays the dad, a fire chief; his son, also a fireman, falls in love with a policeman. They met at a flaming car crash – hot. Their love-making scenes so needy, so desperate, and romantic; they make me yearn for a man to love, even more. And I cry when lovers die, or end their relationships, to “move on”.

When I was nineteen, I had l’Amour Feu, what the French call crazy love. It made me do silly things like sing and play my guitar under the window of my lover’s college dorm. His roommates thought I was nuts. My stomach physically hurt, when I didn’t have my arms around him.

A few years later, when I was almost twenty-one, Steven, was another Crazy Love. We were obsessed to lie our bodies together and passionately kiss, for hours on end. When he disappeared for six months and I suddenly encountered him on a YMCA rooftop solarium, we couldn’t help but start kissing again. I lost my Y membership over that one. So embarrassing, when they hauled us off the roof and took away my Y card, in front of everyone. When you are in a hot cocoon of love and desire and gripped by l’Amour Feu, reason goes out the window. You don’t care who sees you, or what they think. That was my history; that was the spine of my love-life.

Thankful, I am that I have no more of those heart-breaking episodes, as sweet as they were. I grew up; I’m too old, for that stuff. I want to love fully, but I want to love as an adult.

After a few days, George texts me. I write back:

“How can you care about me, and send me big red emoji hearts? How can you love me, and call me darling, when we have never met?” He texts back, “I’m not sure you want to know.” Then I write, “Of course, I do. Tell me, tell me, please? Why? Why? Why, George? I need to know."" Often in life and love, there are no easy answers.

And there are no more texts from George. So I go back and join the ranks of the lovelorn, in the middle of a pandemic, that knows no end.

 If I was going to title this post, I would call it , Queer Love in the Time of COVID"

It was fun reading an overview of the project and some of the results the researchers are finding, although now I feel like the experiment has been tainted since we know what the scientists are looking for :)).

Okay, Just kidding. While I thought the reporter did a good job, it all felt very meta--a story within a story, and confirmed my commitment to this project.  Because every time a reporter or writer tries to make sense of something, they impose their own structure on top of it. By design, a report will always be reductionist, trying to make sense of the ""data"" or the ""noise"".

So  that made me feel even better about the time I take to write here, where we share our raw feelings. I know these will be far more valuable because no one is interpreting what we say or trying to make a story out of OUR stories. Our thoughts and stories are ALL OURS! I really love the idea that future historians will have all this raw data to draw from and understand what life was like during this pandemic. So, future historians, when we're all dead and buried and you're huddling inside from polar vortex frigid winters and oppressively hot-baked summers, I hope you will find our stories useful/instructive/entertaining.

Anyway, here's my story for Feb 16.

 My mother, who is 85, went in to a nursing home right when the pandemic started, around March of 2020. She has not been out in the world since it started. She has also been in serious cognitive decline since then. We think she has dementia/early Alzheimer's. So it's a struggle to keep her updated on why she can't go anywhere. Thank God she has forgotten most things such as her apartment and her cats. She is also now used to weekly zoom calls with my two brothers and can joke around with us through the screen.

Anyway,  today was warm enough (45+ -- one of the few places in the US not crushed by the polar vortex) for me to have an outdoor visit with her. She's been depressed and keeps asking me when she can leave the nursing home. I decided that I would try to cheer her up with some music. So I brought my phone and a bluetooth speaker and a really good dancing playlist I'd made on Spotify, with all kinds of R+B and disco.

So After we chatted for a few minutes, I said ""let's dance."" I went to turn on the playlist and...

GRRRRR! No cell service.

Luckily I still had music in itunes, so I put on Jorge Ben, Ponta de Lança Africano, also known as Umbabarauma, a great samba funk dancing song. Like a wild woman I waved my arms and boogied around the patio while my mother.........

burst into hysterical fits of laughter!! She could not keep her head up she was laughing so hard.

Okay, the point was to get her moving, get her heart rate up and have some fun.

But I guess if she had fun at my expense that's okay too. I had no idea I was such a bad dancer and normally I might have been insulted. But we're one year into a pandemic and honestly, the only way to survive this is to just let go!!!!

 Truly, it was nice to see her laugh like that. Totally made my day."
20,journal-entry-7996," I will be 70 in June. In many ways, I feel as though the last year has taken away the precious time of savoring the last drop of my 60s. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune illness in 2020. As my symptoms worsened, I felt as though I marked each day's toll of rising Covid cases and deaths with the growing fire in my joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons."
21,journal-entry-8015," No. The pandemic has not changed my political views. I am conservative in my views. That does not stop me from practicing hand washing, and masking.

I thought that Trump did the right thing when he closed travel from China early last year, but the opposition called him a racist. He said that we were going to have a vaccine at the end of the year - he was criticized and laughed at for that.

The construction of the wall has been stopped. Expect illegal entries and problems associated with an open border to increase.

The WHO has come to the conclusion that the virus did not come from a lab in Wuhan; that it might have come from meat products from Australia. What!!?

Impeachment is a process of removing someone in office. Yet majority of the US senators voted to proceed with the impeachment process. It boggles my mind that these people are in office!"
22,journal-entry-7987," My husband has been the only other person here in my ""bubble"" . We have not had anyone else in our home for 10 months. We have only been with people outside, masked and distanced. My husband is very reclusive. He is one of Illinois exonerated death row inmates and suffers from PTSD. Lock down because of covid19 is heaven for him! Nothing in his life has really changed. He is an organic vegetable farmer and never liked leaving the farm. Because all my activities have been put on hold he is the sole source of my in person interaction. That is difficult for him. Because his life hasn't really been affected he does not share my sense of loss of all the things that made up who I am as a person."
23,journal-entry-7788, My spouse has become obsessed with cleaning and covid safety. I am a scientist and do the risk analysis of any action I take. She on the other hand assumes always the worst case scenario. On a daily basis this creates a lot of tension between us.
24,journal-entry-7807,"Hello. It is February 16, 2021.

 We are approaching the March 11 anniversary of the day Coronavirus shut the world down. I have kept a handwritten journal for more than 30 years, 2-3 times a week. My electronic journal will be similar, but point to the direct effects the Coronavirus had on me and my family.

Some background. I am a dual citizen, US-Israeli. I grew up in New Jersey but moved to Israel permanently in 1998. I live part of the year in Manhattan and part of the year in Jerusalem, Israel, where my wife and daughter live. So while my profile says that I live in the US alone, that is only partly true.

I am a highly educated, multi-lingual ex-pat whose view of the United States is both one of a native son and a foreigner who speaks American English.

 My entries will be about the impact of Covid on me, my business, how the virus shut down my life. The effects of prolonged loneliness and isolation, both physical and mental. I will try to keep my entries brief and readable."
25,journal-entry-7783,"I feel such an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. At least once a day I think, “I can’t possibly do this another day/week/month/year.” I’m not even sure what “do this” means... but  I can’t help but think I’m missing out on the prime of my life and even as hard as I try to do all the things to keep going and take care of my physical/mental health, it feels like a ride a terrifying wave of feelings and emotions each day. I feel like I can accomplish a lot in one day through remote school and work but more and more it feels meaningless. I think I’ll cry the next time I sit in a classroom or I stand in a concert hall if/when it ever happens."
1,journal-entry-7797," South Africa started with a hard lock down, where for about 6 weeks we were not allowed to leave the house except to acquire groceries. Followed by another couple months where we could only leave to exercise outside for limited periods in the day. That was last year, but it set a precedent and new routine for my daily life, of not really doing... Anything. Before I was out of the house for work and then usually sport (Ultimate, been cancelled ever since, and rock climbing, which I've stopped doing because the gym is too far from home) late into most evenings. Now I've swapped a pretty long commute for more work hours, and after work I cook and watch TV most days. Part of me likes the lazy, part of me hates myself for it. A lot of my social interaction came from Ultimate and other big group activities that are no longer permitted, so its5 been hard not to have that exposure to people,like, in general. For me that cliche of forgetting how to have a normal conversation I think rings true.

There are plenty of other restrictions too, like travel and alcohol sales which have affected me physically but not really psychologically, I don't think"
2,journal-entry-7808,"February 16, 2021

 In the first week of March 2020, I was attending a conference in Brooklyn, NY. I have been an independent marketing consultant since 1999--a digital nomad before the word existed. Business had slowed under the unstable Trump regime. The United States is not used to political instability, and it affected the corporate budgets I depended on for work.

However, things were looking up at the beginning of March 2020. I had been invited to speak at a conference in Florida. I had two very large corporate projects coming in. I had plans to fly to Israel to join my wife and daughter for a Passover holiday.

Yes, we had heard about Covid. There were hand sanitizers at the conference. But we did not think it would affect us.

 A week after the conference the world stopped. Mark the date. March 11, 2020.

All work stopped. New York went dark. All travel canceled. I wouldn't have another meal with a live person for nearly six months.

 I recently found a To-Do list dated March 2, 2020. I wondered if I should keep it as an historical document."
3,journal-entry-7730," Hi. Tensions are high. I'm in a household with 3 other adults- my mom, stepdad, and younger brother. And dog. The dog is the pandemic MVP.

I've been a theatre artist since I was 10, and a dancer since I was 3. Now as I try to apply my skills to finding a different job, I've been met by a lot of unexpectedly heavy feelings.

 I've lost my whole context for myself in losing theatre this year and am feeling empty and lost for the first time.

 My community has dispersed all over the country, my show closed in March.

 Applying my skills to something new feels so daunting. Not only because finding work in general is an obstacle course right now, but the job- and purpose- I've had for most of my life is so all-consuming. It's fulfilling and challenging- so much training. Spilling intimate traumas out in front of a college masterclass full of 60 some other students and faculty.

You think of all you've strived for, sweat, cried, humiliated yourself, pushed, and overcome for...

And you don't want to do any other job.

You think- I think- I shouldn't have to have any other job. To start again.

But we're all having to start again, and certainly, that's what life is about whether we like it or welcome it or not.

That doesn't mean I can't be sad (I remind myself). I miss theatre. I miss myself. I know we all do."
4,journal-entry-7729, I have a 95 year old mother who just moved into skilled nursing unit due to a fall and fracture of her shoulder. She lives 5 hours away by car and have not seen her (other than facetime/zoom) since the pandemic began due to restrictions at her facility. She was recently vaccinated and just recently is now able to have visitors for a short stay. At home my fiance has struggled with the isolation and especially the onset and continuation of a particularly difficult winter. Although a writer who appreciates the solitude she has come to realize how important socialization has been to her. That has created some challenges to our relationship although it has also helped strengthen it as we continue to work through this period.
5,journal-entry-7470,"The pandemic has left in me a feeling of longing because I haven't been to my home country in over a year now, and although I've been away for extended periods of time before, this time feels different because during quarantine I was living alone. Quarantine forced me to be more in tune with my feelings in a way that I had never been before, which turned into a double-edged sword, because I realized how much I took home for granted in the past and developed a new appreciation for it, however, it also made me realize how much I missed home."
6,journal-entry-7453,"No conozco a mis vecinos.  La gente en la calle reproduce su propia interpretación de autocuidado. Nadie sabe contar los 6 pies de distancia, y la variedad de máscaras y respuestas a las mismas que la muchedumbre reparte a diestra y siniestra me indican sólo una cosa: a nadie le importa -en el fondo- el otro hasta que el otro es un peligro en potencia.  Y ni así, porque el peligro en potencia tiene que ser inmediato, para uno, de otra forma el peligro es algo distante y, por lo tanto, casi inofensivo.

En el barrio es posible mantener distancia, saludar de lejos. Todos los vecinos, atendiendo a la manía del espacio personal, se saludan desde aún más lejos comprendiendo que la enfermedad está como intermediara en las relaciones diarias, al menos hasta que la vacuna alcance para todos. Pero es diferente en las calles, las farmacias, los centros de compra, los supermercados, los hospitales. El pánico sigue hacinando a la gente, que ahora se mira con desconfianza y juicio, se esquiva con una expresión de enfrentamiento.

 Definitivamente, no creo que esta pandemia haya hecho algo diferente que fragmentarnos aún más como sociedad.  La desigualdad social en que vivimos distorsiona tanto nuestra visión de las cosas, que a la distancia física se le llama ""distancia social"", como si no tener acceso a comida de calidad o educación digna, como si ser asesinado por la policía por tu color de piel no significara un asunto de distancia, profunda distancia social. Lo otro, la distancia física, no es más que el paroxismo del mal utilizado concepto del espacio personal, que, a fin de cuentas, no es más que una percepción, entendiendo que estamos constantemente hipervigilados a través de las redes y la tecnología.

La pandemia, a fin de cuentas, nos ha desmembrado el resquicio de solidaridad que teníamos en el mundo."

Everything is the same

Still unsure of the future

8,journal-entry-7049,"Hay una urgencia por el movimiento que no permite pensar. Sobre todo aquí, el país de los automóviles, moverse a pie es tremendamente difícil y hasta peligroso. Sumando a el peligro que el virus representa, es imposible salir a caminar al parque sin tener la angustia atascada en la garganta.  La necesidad de mantenerse encerrado por el nivel de incertidumbre y falta de disciplina que reina entre la gente, es una mordaza que ahoga. 

En general, no salgo más que para los trámites esenciales: una vez al mes para retirar mis pastillas en la farmacia, acaso una vuelta al supermercado de junto para agarrar la leche de emergencia, y de ahí el correo y la basura. No es que mi mundo se haya reducido, en todo caso. Generalmente, me la paso escribiendo y leyendo, jugando con mi hijo y trabajando. No hay mucho cambio en esa rutina desde que llegó el virus. Pero, las posibilidades que ignoraba respecto de mis necesidades sociales, se han agigantado hasta la desmesura. Todo fuera de la casa me parece urgente, y las cosas que antes detestaba, como el mall o los supermercados - y en el fondo, todas estas actividades transaccionales tan normalizadas en este país-, se han convertido en la necesidad primaria para mantener la cordura.  La última vez que me sentí así fue hace 7 u 8 años, cuando recién llegué y estaba aprendiendo el idioma. Entonces me pasaba horas escribiendo en mi diario, leyendo los libros que me traje, o echado sobre el sillón en silencio. Y hay algo de eso en este encierro, una suerte de aislamiento inmaterial que sofoca. Para colmo, mi manera de relacionarme con el mundo es a través del tacto y el movimiento, y eso está totalmente descartado en este período de la historia. Si antes, por el maldito espacio personal, estaba restringido a expresarme con una metálica sonrisa y la carcajada de rigor,   hoy no me queda más que ver una leve curvatura de los ojos cuando alguien sonríe. Y se sonríe bien poco últimamente. "
9,journal-entry-7457," I think the most obvious and impactful restriction so far is the stay at home orders that we faced at the beginning and height of the pandemic, which we are facing again now. Living in NYC, I thrived on the freedom to walk out of my apartment and go do whatever I wanted.... and sometimes that included doing absolutely nothing, just walking aimlessly around my neighborhood or on the high line. The biggest impact of social distancing is not being able to go out and do nothing for fear of the risk that it could lead to potential exposure. Before I moved back into my college dorm, I felt like back in the city everything I was doing had to have a purpose. Every small errand turned into a journey that I would have to plan for hours in advance. At the height of the pandemic planning on my visit to trader joe's took longer than the actual shopping itself.

 The next big factor is the lack of social contact. Ever since being a child, I have thrived on being in social settings and making people laugh, sharing interesting stories from around the world, and just being able to talk. With social distancing measures in place, I feel as though there is a piece of semi-opaque glass between me and the outside world. While I may still be able to express myself and behave the same way, the message does not hold the same weight as there exists bigger fish to fry. Covid happened to coincide with other big life changes I decided to make and in all honesty, I think I would be a different person sitting here today writing this pandemic journal entry if one of the many moving parts in my life was a few months off schedule. To that point, I know that the part I play in trying to end this pandemic is something I have been taking serious by staying socially distant, constantly wearing masks, and volunteering at a local hospital hit hard by the pandemic, and the rest is not in my hands.

 At times it is frustrating seeing my sacrifices being pushed under the rug or cancelled out by the ignorance of others."
10,journal-entry-7467,"It is less covid and more ridiculous amounts of snow that have affected my life in the last week. We live in some rural hills and already had between shin and thigh deep snow around our farm for a few weeks (overall have had snow since 23 December non stop) but there was a massive storm yesterday with very fast winds that caused huge drifts and now in some places it is waist deep or more! The gale was so loud it kept us awake all night and it sucks all the heat out of the house so fast. It was beautiful - with the clouds of snow travelling in the wind, it looked like the whole landscape was constantly shifting and glimmering - but caused so much havoc. It has closed nearly all roads in the area including major connections to cities like Aberdeen and Inverness. On the moors the snow is also waist deep on the actual roads themselves, not just around it. Everything ground to a halt yesterday, even more so than it already has due to covid. All the sheep are hiding together in the little shelter in their fields and the birds are barely able to fly. It has caused disruption to my family's life in that we usually order my grandparents an online food shop that arrives on Sundays so they don't have to go into the shops themselves but we had to reschedule it as 1. we aren't sure they would even be able to deliver it, even though my grandparents live in town where the roads are comparatively clear and 2. if they did deliver it, my grandma is too lame with a bad knee to put it away herself and we cannot get out of our farm to go and do it for her as we usually do (we are allowed to provide her essential household support under the rules in this country provide we wear masks inside). Luckily she has food in the freezer but it is a bit worrying to be cut off from supplies. We also know someone who had to go into hospital on Friday 13 Feb for an operation on a swelling in front of their eye who was meant to come out of hospital yesterday morning but no one could come and pick them up and all transport was cancelled - buses, trains, taxis etc. - so the hospital luckily let them stay another night as there was not really any other option."
11,journal-entry-7461," Oddly, money has not been an issue. As I mentioned, I was asked to teach and extra class to help mitigate numbers. I also have the part time teaching job I picked up in September to help with me taking the first trimester off. That part time job turns my teaching job into my life as I don’t have any real breaks between my day job and my night job. At the beginning of the pandemic, I said I could do anything with a time stamp. I feel that way about this work grind. I am working over 70 hours a week and putting every ounce of my being into it. I am tired and sick of it all. I want to quit and I want to take a break, but it’s not who I am. I will finish it out, it has a time stamp, I can do it. And the extra money has afforded us to do some extra stuff. I can do (really) hard things."
12,journal-entry-7454," COVID is really getting in the way of seeing people I want to spend time with. N. had a meltdown and ""I need a HUG!"" and insists that becuase she is vaccinated, she can't be a carrier; but the science on that isn't in, and I'm hesitant. And I'm increasingly aware that I enjoy D. in person, but he's not as good an email buddy. And climate activism--forget it! THough I gotta say it's a lot easier to get people togehter for ""meetings.'

 Next week I have a virtual MD appointment for a minor problem. Which probably would be resolved by now if I could get actual treatment with PT. But all I can do is get advice for self-treatment. Not to mention--need a tooth pulled, eye exam, PE--all of which are on hold.

But after waiting through the interminable hold time on NH 211,  I got my second vaccination moved up, to next Sunday! Great. Except--I'm living with E., who won't be vaccinated for months. So until we know whether I can be a carrier even though vaccinated, I have to take the same precuations as I have been.

 And I' thinking that if the Senate acquits Trump, which no doubt they will, we should all be in the streets. But no one has mentioned that, or is organizing anything...sigh.

14,journal-entry-6557," I've been thinking a lot more lately about life post-pandemic. But, it's hard to picture, and now I don't believe it will look at all like it did before the pandemic. I do believe I'll be able to interact and hug and see my loved ones again as before. But, that's going to take a long time still. I think it won't be until the Fall, or Winter of 2021 before we are able to be sort of normal again. But, I think we're always going to be thinking about the next pandemic or epidemic. That's always going to be on the back of my mind. I think the workplace is forever changed. The pandemic showed a spotlight on a lot of problems in our country: lack of access to healthcare, racism (in healthcare, workplace, elections, police enforcement, etc.), sexism, rampant increase of misinformation, and the radicalization of moderate conservatives and the rise in domestic terrorism (i.e. Militias, Proud Boys, KKK, etc.).  My hope is that we'll work to make improvements in all of these areas because I really feel like we took a lot of steps backwards during the pandemic. I feel like we lost civility and what it means to look out for and take care of each other. Maybe it was always like that, but I think it got worse during the pandemic. I think overnight we went from trying to follow the Golden Rule to looking out for ourselves and our own."
15,journal-entry-6540," I'm choosing to write about this issue because this is the first time I'm hearing that there's a racist component to discourse about COVID!  I suppose I shouldn't be shocked because so many things are interpreted through a racist lens when it comes to medicine as well as so many other issues. Living in France where no one talks overtly about race, though, has kept me in a bubble--and I would say that here, at least in the media and public discourse, race is really not at all discussed as playing any role in the pandemic, beyond the context of socio-economic disparity (e.g. the virus spreading more quickly in the banlieue where large families live in close proximity to one another; the children in those areas being worse affected by school closing/online learning)--which, of course, often correlates with race. The only connection to race that I've heard has come  from the Indian community, where people are speculating about a magic/mythic South Asian gene that can help protect against catching the virus or mitigate its effects."
16,journal-entry-7442," Last week I received an email with sign-ups for a vaccine and when I went to the websites, there were actually slots! So I signed up. I was feeling a little guilty because although technically I am an ""educator"" and therefore in group 1C, it's not clear when/if we're going back in person. But the rollout has been so chaotic, everyone said to me ""just get the shot."" So my husband drove me up to the site, and when they were checking me in, they said ""Are you a health care worker?""

I said ""no, an educator.""

They said, ""Sorry, this is a county site. We're only doing 1A.""

What a crazy mess. No wonder people are frustrated. So now I have an appointment at a mass vaccination site in March, but I'm going to call first to be sure I'm eligible. Apparently a ton of educators went to the same site I did and we were all turned away. Our county is being really strict with its doses through the county clinics. I'm not sure why.

 Meanwhile the state is now punishing our county by holding back doses because they're not being distributed fast enough. So now we have to look for statewide or pharmacy sites. Yikes. I'm trying not to stress about it. I'm just staying home as much as I can. Although my husband is back at work in a school and two weeks ago two of his coworkers tested positive and the principal didn't tell the other staff because of privacy. WTF? How is that even allowed?

 On an up note, we've been ""traveling"" to India via our airbnb guests from Delhi who have been cooking us wonderful meals. Tomorrow, in exchange, we're making blueberry pancakes and smoothies for them. It's been fun have foreigners here... we chat from a distance and exchange meals.

 Why doesn't every home have a set of government-issued safety supplies and a manual for how to use them correctly? It has been nearly a year. The latest CDC advice now mentions using a ""mask fitter."" I look up mask fitters and get a bunch of DIY guides. This isn't even an established product!

She is never NOT on my mind, but she especially has been on my mind this past week, and I have notice myself feeling sadder and missing her more than usual. I think it is because in my state, people who are 75+ are recently eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine, and if my mother were still alive, she would have just turned 75 a few weeks ago. I am still in touch with her closest friend, and I recently helped her navigate the online system to set up a vaccine appointment for next week. This is something that I absolutely, positively, without a doubt in my mind would have done for my mother too. I would have driven my mother entirely across the state if it meant that she could get a vaccine sooner. In some ways, I am glad that my mother was spared living through the COVID-19 pandemic. As weird as it sounds, I am grateful that if she had to get sick and die from pancreatic cancer, that it happened in the spring of 2019 instead of the spring of 2020 (even if it would have meant having more time with her). But, I miss her so much -- and I miss the triumph of helping her get her COVID-19 vaccine. How weird is that?"
24,journal-entry-6106,"Me sentí muy feliz porque, a pesar de las circunstancias, me logré certificar por el Ministerio de Educación de mi país, como tutora virtual y a distancia por un período de 5 años.

 Todos los años intento hacer algo que me haga sentir que no estoy estancada, que estoy caminando hacia alguna meta personal importante. Casi siempre enfoco mis esfuerzos en el campo educativo o de capacitación: trato de aprender algo nuevo o de mejorar mis habilidades.

 Este año inicié muy bien con un curso sobre las estrategias educativas de colaboración en el ámbito virtual. Pero luego, vino la pandemia y casi todos los planes que tenía cambiaron.  Surgió esta posibilidad de certificarme gracias a un voluntariado que realizo desde el año pasado. Me esforcé por completar las fases del proceso de certificación y este es el resultado: lo logré. Estoy muy feliz.

Incluso tengo un chiste personal sobre el proceso, ya que estaba con esa gripe fuerte que me dio cuando me tocó grabar un video para el proceso de certificación. Le llamo mi video COVID-19.

 Lo cierto es que, cuando veo que otras personas dicen que el año 2020 fue un año de mi*rda, yo no coincido con eso. Es cierto: mi trabajo quedó congelado, pasé serios problemas económicos, me tuve que acoger al programa de ayuda gubernamental, me enfermé, me tuve que mudar... Aún así no siento que el año tenga la culpa. Fue un año difícil, pero somos nosotros, como humanidad, los que nos hemos puesto en esta situación. El año no tiene la culpa en sí. 

Todos esperan que termine. Terminará, sin duda. Lo importante será continuar encontrando estas razones de felicidad en lo que venga. De eso se trata la vida."
25,journal-entry-7374,"When considering money, I have big concerns because a lot of the money distributed by government isn’t going to people who really need it. I as well as many friends I’ve talked to are retired and living on fixed incomes. We all qualify for this financial help because our incomes are relatively low, but yet we don’t have any financial need. Most of us live in homes with no mortgage and easily live within our needs. All of us have affordable healthcare. Some of us have pensions or social security and the security of some investments. Most of us travel modestly and vacation occasionally. None of us are in danger of being homeless or food challenged. We don’t need the money from the government. After the first two dole outs, I made donations to charities, but would rather that the government put more consideration into qualification for receiving future enhancements. There must be many more like us who have little real need."

3,journal-entry-7361,"Because I have an old iPhone that I use for journaling, I disconnect the WiFi button when I am not using the internet. Turning it back on today, I missed seeing the routine email for this journaling project. I scrolled down to an earlier email and started reading the featured entries. It saddened me to read some entries that dealt with some people’s personal problems - their problems appear to exist prior to, but is worsened by, the pandemic.

 I am grateful for our good health, and good financial condition considering the pandemic. Being retired, and being confined to the home (going out only to pick up our medications or buy groceries), my husband and I are in constant company. I am glad that I like and get along with my husband, otherwise I may be one of those complaining.

 We continue to pray daily for the end of the pandemic. I will also pray for a good resolution of the personal problem/s of those whose entries I read."
4,journal-entry-7333," This journaling is turning out to be a godsend--after some weeks not having much to say, I am finding myself really needing to pour out my thoughts and feelings, amid the hope provided by the new vaccines, the frustration at their slow (and too often ill-designed) rollout, and fear that by the time they get around to me, new variants of the virus are going to render the vaccines largely useless."
5,journal-entry-7302,"Right now. Right now feels like every other minute of the day, of the week, of the month. Right now feels like forever. ...Right now feels so long and without any end in sight, without a change. Right now wants to be soaking up this newborn, born in the height of the pandemic.  Instead, right now is negotiating relationships, controlling emotions, managing emotions, providing; interestingly enough, not for myself but for every one else. Right now feels like a missed opportunity; constantly grieving the loss of time with just [my baby] and my own loss of time."
6,journal-entry-7299," Noticing this week that some people like me are enjoying adapting to meeting on zoom, for others the technical side or the weird impersonal feeling are hard. In my pain group we had an interpersonal explosion this week that I think would have been different in person. Plus we have a bigger, more consistent group than when we met in person and I think that is pushing us toward greater intimacy and different kinds of conflict.

 Grateful that all these kinds of support are available to us over Zoom -- pain group, grief support group."
7,journal-entry-7305, I feel angry that I have to make a decision if I want to leave my house or not because some people think wearing a mask infringes on their right to free choice!  but what if they get covid and have to quarantine themselves? Then they will wish they wore a mask!
8,journal-entry-7320," We're double masking now. A year into this and we're double masking. I thought we'd have the virus under control to have some semblance of normal life. But we can't count on each other to do that here. America the free. I have a private office downtown - very low risk, no shared elevator, just a walk up in an old building. I still only go in to check mail and water plants.

 I continue to be blessed with work, as does my husband. He, however, was already someone with a tendency to self-isolate. He rarely leaves the house to begin with. I am someone who needs alone time. I don't get it. But then, who does or who has in the past year? I have grown so tired of his inability to attend to anything that isn't emanating from a device, that I write long private missives in journals where I scream and rant and rage. He hasn't asked about my father in a week. My father - my favorite human in the world and who has done nothing but support and be interested in my husband. My father who is in convalescent care after a hospitalization. How does a week go by without inquiring?

 He sees me sullen at the sink one evening and says ""What's wrong? Work stuff? Family?"" I said, ""It's been a rollercoaster week with my dad, since the care meeting on Tuesday...."" He looks at me blankly. ""...I told you my brother and I had a care plan meeting with the entire staff...on Tuesday?""  His response: ""Is this the part of the conversation where you make me feel small for not having remembered something?""

He turns it on me.

He turns it the fuck on me.

I text my best friend. She says, ""Well. that would be the appropriate response, for him to feel small, because it's outrageous to forget.""

Wish I'd had the presence of mine to say as much to him - instead, I walked away.

Never did get an apology.

Per an NYT opinion piece about Michael Goldhaber - a physicist? anyway, he popularized the notion of an ""attention economy"" over 20 years ago. He believes that every single action we take is a transaction - so it's a zero sum endeavor: when you pay attention to one thing, you ignore something else.

 I have been the something else ignored for so damned long. The pandemic has made me question why I've acquiesced to living like this for so long. I do everything - truly everything other than taking out the trash snd recycling every week. Everything else is me - shopping, meal planning, cooking, cleaning, paying the bills, budgeting, prepping our taxes, fixing/painting/patching/repairing. Every. Goddamned. Thing. Why have I done this for 20 years? Why should I keep doing so? What am I getting out of this relationship? Sure, there is love and affection there, when pressed, but the actual attention? The partnership? Nope. Not there.

Jesus Christ."
9,journal-entry-1082,"Corona has severely exacerbated the deficits/struggled in my life. I’m a single mom who had little help before; now there’s no help. My kid was having some behavioral struggles; now those are full blown daily disasters. Work was tough working with the homeless as a social worker; now it feels impossible and I can’t ever leave work in time. I felt like I was just barely treading water; now I’ve been drowning. Every day. Over and over again. I felt isolated and struggling to find community; now I am completely isolated, on our own island with just the 2 of us. I struggled w confidence about being enough for my kid and knowing what he needs; now I feel hopeless and helpless about those same things. I worried about the political splits in our country; now those seem concretized, as even a pandemic can’t get us to treat each other as human. I used to rarely cry; now I am constantly on the verge of tears. I used to feel alone, worrying about me being the only one to put me and my family first; now I know that’s the case. I am so much better off that most people and was ok with just grimly hanging on, getting through every day, and now every day feels like forever."
10,journal-entry-656," I have found myself wondering if this pandemic will last more than another 12 months - could it be two years? How will that change our whole society? It feels like we are adrift as a society - Europe seems to have it under control. Australia has hardly been touched. Canada likewise is weathering this - and the cases have EXPLODED in most of the country. Our state, Connecticut, seems like a little raft in a sea of disease - and as the CNN folks said this evening, it can all come back. Learning that antibodies don't seem to last long was a hit as well. Our president is inept, the economy is reeling, and we have no idea how long this will reverberate. It is scary. But then, I just turn back to my own work, writing, gardening, sewing, cooking, cleaning, repainting rooms, doing zoom with friends, calling family ... watching an evening mystery series, reading, sleeping and then starting over again.

Now that the first wave is over and the hospital is quiet, I am still terrified of contracting the disease and spreading to others. It's always hanging over me when I see patients in the hospital. I continue to wear an N95 daily- which is uncomfortable. I am not sure we can handle another wave. I am infuriated at our current administration and how poorly he has and continues to handle this crisis. I do watch a little too much news.

12,journal-entry-439," Coronavirus has caused me to become more angry. As much of an introvert/extrovert I am, more introvert, being inside has not been as great as people made it out to be.

I haven’t seen my boyfriend since the beginning of March and I just want to be able to live my life. It comes down to me not being treated as an adult despite me turning 19 in Sept.

I am sick and tired of being locked in the house like i’m some type of animal. like i’m being sheltered from a world i already know the dangers of. I don’t understand why I must continue to be treated like a child but coronavirus has just brought out the worse in my parents and everything. I hate being home and I wish I had somewhere else to stay. I don’t want to be here with these people but i’m stuck here with nowhere else to go. at this point, as selfish or whatever it may sound, I’d rather be homeless than live another day in this house. that might sound dramatic and me being angry but i’m done with this."

 El virus sólo nos a afectado en la distancia, ya que constantemente queremos hacer una fiesta o reunirnos para hacer una carne asada, pero resistimos a la tentación y resguardados nuestra energía en las llamadas constantes para comunicarnos.

Mi situación económica parece mejorar ahora que he conseguido un trabajo de medio tiempo, y en la comodidad de mi hogar, he recibido mucho apoyo por eso.

Falta poco para poder entrar a la universidad, aunque de eso es lo que menos he pensado, todo el tiempo me la paso diciendo que extraño las clases presenciales, pero, como siempre, debo acostumbrarme a esta nueva normalidad.

Muchas sorpresas se están planeando para el próximo año, así que  ruego constantemente con que las cosas se tranquilicen , dudo mucho que todo se resuelva hasta entonces, pero deseo que tengamos mucha más posibilidad de volver a nuestras pasiones y ambiciones. Con las medidas sanitarias, claro está."

It makes me kind of sad  because I was hoping to maybe get a group together for outdoor dining, but doesn't seem like people are up for that.

While I am grateful that I have the means to access medicine and care to help control my symptoms, they are ever-present. I am not afraid of being sick. Rather, I am afraid that those around me will not do the right thing to mitigate the spread. I know everyone has ""covid fatigue "" and wants to return to some sort of normalcy, but the disregard for others ' health and wellness is depressing. I am witnessing people's breaking point in real time."
17,journal-entry-7244,"5 Feb 2021. TIME FOR REFLECTION

 The Friday Morning Seminar today was high energy, three wonderful presentations, one on comparative experiences in Quebec (both with British Colombia and with the U.S.), one on behavior with masks and the messages written on masks; and one on this journaling project and the challenges of collective ethnographic in this mode as well as future challenges of archiving and analyzing. The Quebec case, told in a TED talk style, using the ""we"" to diffuse some of the blaming of individuals although the Premier Legault came in for some scrutiny, especially when he replaced a health minister with public health experience with a businessman with no public health experience; his attack on the press (especially an experienced health reporter, Aaron Deful. Editorial cartoons helped make a number of points about Quebec's ""exceptionalist"" ideology, and the ""aesthetics of statistics"", that is the way in which statistics are used politically but are themselves often not transparent. The blame game has some traction, until one begins to see stark parallels with other places, particularly the U.S. (exceptionalism albeit on different grounds, efforts to control the statistics and narrative, attack on journalists, attacks on Asians; and explosion of cases, and staff burnout, before they are finally brought under control). The contrast with B.C. is stark: BC did much better in controlling the pandemic, while Quebec's death rate per capita exploded in June to the fifth highest in the world. Yet, amazingly enough, the rate now has been brought down to that of Vermont, one of the lowest. Some of this had to do with nursing logistics for long term care facilities: in the beginning nurses were going from facility to facility carrying the infection along with them; eventually there was a mandate of being allowed to work only one facility and the army was called in to help. Another key failure was ignoring the immigrant and racialized communities of North Montreal (with no plan in place), exacerbated by the lack of collecting data in these communities. Instead the province relied on a ""zone-linked"" alert system. Some of all of this, as in the US has to do with decaying public health care (even though it is Canada with universal health care): budgets for decades have been balanced by cutting budgets for health, leading to shortages of health care workers. Eventually lockdown and curfew (8pm-5am), closing of restaurants and bars, mask mandates (as well as the border), and other controls, the rates of infection have gone down. Suggestion that one think about pandemics as redistribution of crises. (E.g. putting off of surgeries, including oncology.)

The talk on masks by a hospital nurse (and PhD anthropologist!) was fascinating in two major ways: first, for the slogans and images with which people customize their mask, and second, because she does screening of patients, her efforts to gently figure out psychological or cultural nudges to get people to take pride in wearing their masks. The first includes political slogans, including the wonderful contradiction of wearing a mask that says ""Jesus is my protector, Trump is my president"" although not wearing masks has become a pro-Trump statement. Still by saying ""I like your mask"", the patient straightened up with pleasure and might wear the mask to propagate his cultural identification. The most poignant of the masques was a picture of the wearer's mother and her dates of birth and death. When she commented on his mask, he too straightened with pleasure, and explained that it was a tribute to his mother, a wonderful woman, who died of COVID, and he liked talking about her, and keeping her memory alive. Others were emblazoned with sports teams symbols (Baltimore Ravens, Star of the Texas Cowboys) or the treads of the Marines combat boots and saying that he had fought in Vietnam and now he would fight COVID>

 The talk on the Journaling Project generated a good deal of excitement and interest, both inherently for trying to capture the ""contemporary history"" of the pandemic in real time, and for the kinds of analyses possible (e.g. seeing the fluctuations and contradictions of people's rating their week's mental health together with their narrative accounts, some saying they had not posted for a while because they were feeling low or depressed, but now felt they could come back to it). Also there was interest in how to handle what is becoming a vlds (very large data set) and issues of archiving.

 Interestingly the writer Stephen King had a piece in the NYT this morning on his thinking process for developing a film on the pandemic, a need to focus narrowly to capture what will be memorable in the future. In this case he wanted to explore Zoom life and its claustrophobia, but not exclude live action. The device is a couple who normally would be separating but because of COVID have to stay together, but whose prior work identities are no longer so all consuming. Learning that big department stores in London had moved out all their most expensive stock fearing riots, he devised a plot about planning a heist at Harrods (something to do together?). He says, ""When reality offers you such an unusual dislocation of what is normal, a situation that no one has been through before, it can be quite gleeful to write about — it’s like stepping on fresh snow."" https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/movies/locked-down-anne-hathaway-chiwetel-ejiofor.html

 So it makes me think: (a) what story nuggets that can endure over time in memory are contained in the Journaling project (and can on access them, whose property, etc.); and (b) what short stories, television, film, etc. creative writing will be generated that ethnographers could use for analytic clues in the Journaling Project.

This week is the beginning of Phase 2 of the COVID vaccination roll out: all who are over 75 are eligible, but neither [of my health providers] actually have any vaccine yet. In Somerville a clinic has been opened for those who are disabled or otherwise will have trouble with access; others are asked to wait.

Otherwise, this week has also been one of a beginning of the national political reflections on January 6. Gun toting, conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga), apologist for 6 Jan, who has endorsed a murder threat against Nancy Pelosi has been stripped of her committee positions with eleven Republicans joining the Democrats; Trump has rejected an invitation to testify or be deposed for his impeachment trial to begin next week and is caught in the cross-hairs of not conceding the election but his lawyers having to argue that his main defense in the trial is that he is no longer President and so can no longer be impeached ; and the first big Biden legislative effort (Rescue America -- COVID relief) has been pushed through using the budget reconciliation provision (requiring only a majority to pass bills that can be shown to have an effect on the budget -- vote along party lines was broken by our new Vice President, Kamala Harris."
18,journal-entry-7257,"I was extremely depressed and overwhelmed this week. Whatever patience, understanding, and generosity people had for the circumstances of the pandemic seems to have completely evaporated, even though we're still months out from going back to ""normal."" I guess it's not unlike grieving a lost loved one, and the hardest time is after people are no longer being gentle with you, but you're not actually over the loss yet. That happens a lot with trauma. And I'm embarrassed and ashamed that the pandemic hasn't hit me as hard as it's hit other people, but I'm really not over how upended my daily life has been for the past year. But everyone around me seems to be back to normal productivity. So what's wrong with me? I hate feeling ""weak,"" that I'm not even close to the level of ""okay"" that everyone around me seems to be.

 I do Irish step dancing as a hobby, and even though it's just a hobby, I miss it terribly. I have not been in a studio in nearly a year. Over the summer I did a few outdoor classes, but other than that, it's just been Zoom classes in my tiny living room all year long. Our instructor is having classes in the studio within the legal restrictions, but it seems like a colossally stupid risk to take. Almost everyone involved in the studio, instructor included, are the type of conservatives that believe QAnon conspiracy theories, think COVID is overblown, and vaccines are dangerous. I know they judge me for being a weak, cowardly sheep for refusing to go back to the studio. I went to one outdoor performance in September after assurance that it was safe, but it wasn't. The venue was way over legal capacity for our state at that time, no one wore masks, and many of the parents openly ridiculed people who were. I don't know why I don't just quit. Before COVID, I simply made my disagreement on politics respectfully known and I loved Irish dance enough to put up with it. I never imagined that those political differences would actually pose a genuine physical safety risk. I really shouldn't be giving a penny to a dance school that's been so reckless with the health and safety of dancers. But Irish dance means a lot to me, and I think it's hard for me to come to terms with the fact that it's time to part with this studio. The fact that I haven't quit on principle is what truly makes me weak and cowardly, not the fact that I refuse to go to the studio.

 Underlying all of that is processing that it will be the *second* St. Patrick's Day with no live performances, no dancing with other people, no singing with other people, no drinking with other people. St. Patrick's Day 2019 I taught some of the younger dancers the claps that go along with Whiskey in the Jar as we watched a band play before we went on. I always make soda bread for my friends. I always do two batches, one regular batch, and one batch with an extra egg in the recipe and raisins replaced with chocolate chips. Nobody taught me that, it was just a random thing I started doing in college and it sort of just stuck. Last year, everything was too swift and novel to really processes the loss. This year, it's almost worse, knowing for a fact that it's just not going to happen."
19,journal-entry-7265,"I just wrote about sleep.  I am an excellent sleeper if you let me. The pandemic does not affect my sleep, my children affect my sleep. I am usually mentally and physically exhausted and so when I lay down, I am out. Until the pitter patter of tiny feet make their way to our bedside or until J. needs to nurse or someone has a nightmare about pickles, or volcanoes, or, the ever dreaded puked in my sleep wake up. I’d say we are averaging 4 hours a night... I’d prefer a full 12:)"
20,journal-entry-3410,"La semana pasada fui a un sitio donde había concurrencia de personas. Por supuesto, que iba bien protegida para evitar riesgos. Sin embargo, la ansiedad que siento todo el día, todos los días, es abrumadora. Empiezo a sudar, me falta el aliento y mi corazón se acelera. Un ataque de ansiedad, de esos que se han vuelto familiares desde hace un par de meses. Más que miedo por mí, me da miedo por mi familia. Me gusta confiar (quizás ingenuamente) que si llego a contagiarme de COVID, saldré adelante. Soy joven, me ejercito, no tengo enfermedades crónicas y mis estudios sanguíneos regulares son excelentes. Pero mi familia, no. Mis papás tienen comorbilidades, mi papá es hipertenso y diabético y mi mamá tiene cardiopatía. Mi abuela vive con nosotros y no me perdonaría contagiarla.

Todos estos pensamientos invaden mi mente y de pronto el fantasma de mi ansiedad comienza a crecer hasta que siento algo en el pecho que me impide respirar.

Durante estos meses de pandemia he perdido a dos familiares, mi abuela materna y mi prima. Ninguna murió por COVID, pero de igual manera la pérdida sacudió a toda la familia y mi miedo a perder a alguien más aumentó de forma exponencial.

Es mucho estrés y me desespera no saber cuándo pasará todo esto."
21,journal-entry-7228," As a student, connecting with my classes can sometimes be hard. I do have a roommate, who is my brother, so I am thankful that I have someone so close to be around that I've grown up with. My dad has COVID right now and he has a lot of the symptoms, but thankfully they have been manageable. He cannot work from home because he works in law enforcement and my mom has had to work from home as well. She is a teacher and sometimes struggles to connect with her students over zoom."
22,journal-entry-7235," I went to a restaurant with my dad, brother, sister and their spouses. I am seeing a woman and visited her after dinner. She was not pleased that I (we) went out to a restaurant. I understand her concern. I have obeyed all health guidelines and have not contracted the virus nor has anyone of my family that I dined with. I know that we need to restrict our movements and contacts and limit groups of people. It's very interesting how different intelligent and reasonable people have different attitudes to the virus and the restrictions that are in place to diminish it's spread."
23,journal-entry-7196," Wow. The whole GameStop short selling thing is absolutely amazing. I completely support the cause of the wallstreetbets Reddit boys, and I live for the fact that it really shows us not only who the rich people and Wall Street brokers care about, but it also shows us what the mainstream media cares about. Don't get me wrong, I'm a registered democrat who voted for Bernie in 2020, but I can't believe how even the originally reputable news sources are trying to spin the whole story in a way that incriminates the individual traders and tries to claim that what they did was 'illegal' in some way. It definitely clearly shows how the people truly have power, and we can't trust media that's funded by big organizations with corporate business motives and conflicts of interest.

 The whole event also seemed to unite a lot of people as well, and I even bought an AMC stock the other day in support of the cause! It was mostly a sign of support since the stock was only $14 (and I've already lost $6 of value since then), but since I can't really bring a sign into the street that says ""We like the stock,"" I figured that making a little dent in the wall street broker's plans and buying some cheap stock in hopes of another short squeeze that'll give the corporate wall street market manipulators a bit of a shock. As I've seen in many memes since then, rich people always say to 'invest' and 'make your own wealth,' but as soon as thousands of normal people start playing their own game they start to backpedal and cry fraud. How suspicious."
24,journal-entry-7203,"Late December and early January are weeks of trying to comfort our best friends, D and V, as D's beloved father, H, is hospitalized with COVID. Food, flowers, wine, puzzles, more food - left on the porch with a quick knock and a wave through the window. How can we not be inside with you, cuddled on the couch and processing and reminiscing as this all transpires?

 January 15. H is gone. COVID ravaged his lungs. Hospitalized since before Christmas, he could not survive outside of a hospital. This fit, healthy, 69 year old man now gone. Of all our parents, the least likely victim.

 Funeral on January 23 consists of watching the private family mass from our phones while in the procession line that will afterward go to the cemetery for the burial. It's a very cold day, indeed.

G comes up from CT for the funeral. His car breaks down somewhere in Massachusetts and he takes an Uber the rest of the way. His own father is here in rehab but has recovered from a cardiac issue and is about to be discharged home. G can't believe that it is H we are burying and not his own father, who is 20 years older and hasn't been well for some time. G asks after my father. Shakes his head.

The night before, on January 22, my father was rushed to the hospital by EMT, after his home health aide found him on the floor and unable to lift himself up. Hospitalized, 800 miles away, with symptoms of COVID. Rapid test in hospital says no, but fever, low oxygen, exhaustion are his symptoms so we don't believe it. Particularly given H tested negative twice in the week before he was hospitalized...and now he's gone.

 Monday, January 25. My husband receives a call from G,  who has returned to CT. His father was in deed discharged to home that morning, and G spoke with him hearing how absolutely thrilled he was to be home. Hours later G received a call from a neighbor who had gone to check in on him. Dead. Watching TV.

 January 31. Remote funeral #2. My husband's two best friends have lost their fathers within a week of each other, and his beloved father-in-law is very ill. And we can't be together during any of it. We can be present, but not really together.

 I hope like hell that we do not accommodate to this way of grieving. ""Together"" alone."
25,journal-entry-7212," My son went back to school yesterday and well, I feel really sad. I've written a lot about what a gift it was to have him home for six months when he took time off from school, and now he's gone back for the spring semester. I'm happy he's happy, but the house feels very empty and I feel really sad I won't see him until maybe June! He's only 300 miles away but his college has a strict no-visitor policy--the students aren't even allowed to leave campus. It's also his birthday next week so I've conspired with his girlfriend, who goes to school with, and will be arriving on his birthday, to pick up some sweets for him. Anyway, it's just sad. Sometimes I think I spend too much time being angry so I don't have to feel sad.

 Yesterday, with my son and daughter, we drove to NYC and back in one day from Washington DC. It felt very surreal. We buzzed into the city, and got some NY pizza and bagels, dropped him with his ride to go the rest of the way to his college, and then she and I headed back out to the NJ turnpike. There were TONS of people everywhere in NYC walking around--maybe because they'd been inside with the snow--??--but you'd never know there was a pandemic (although most people were masked).

Anyway, it was nice to have time with my kids (even if just in a minivan on the highway) but it was sad to go to NYC too, because we were in the neighborhood where my dad and stepmom lived for 30 years--my father died about 6 years ago and then my stepmother last year, so it was weird being in their neighborhood without them. We all felt sad that they were gone, and that our family can't gather the way we use to, and how strange it was that they never knew about the pandemic. My father, a lawyer, never even had to experience the Trump years, which probably was just as well because Trump would have made him insane. But driving through their neighborhood made me really sad, saying good bye to my son, talking with my daughter who has become completely cynical this year...just a big day of sadness.

 meanwhile, we are in a strange place where my husband and daughter have both gotten the vaccine (they are eligible--nurse and teacher) and it will be months before I do. I don't care, I don't want to cut the line--I'm healthy, I work at home, etc...but I worry that they will get lax, so I have to keep reminding them that I have zero protection. I hope we can make it through the next few months until the rest of the vaccines become available.

I am, of course, completely worried about these new variants. I don't trust the US public to be safe--and here we are, on the verge of beating this thing back with the vaccinations and the lower case counts.

But what's going to happen? People are going to have Superbowl parties and stop wearing masks and then we're going to get swamped by these more contagious variants and we'll get set back months and months.

 I just wish Biden or Fauci or someone would go on TV and broadcast this every night: Stay home. Stay safe. Wear a mask. Just wait it out. We are almost there. Don't fuck it up, America!"
1,journal-entry-7219,"Food is the source of the restaurant industry.  A restaurant lives and dies by the way that supplies are procured. A national chain has no differences a small local restaurant. With no food to serve, there is no way to make money. 

In a national chain, the food comes in from central warehouses. It is also partially prepared, so that the recipes, ingredients and sources stay secret. But  shortages become obvious when we have to tell customers that their favorite dish is not in stock right now. What I cannot determine is if the shortage is related to COVID or something else. At this time of year, a lot of vegetables and fruits get imported from Mexico and South American countries while it is the summer growing season in the Southern Hemisphere. And, in the last federal administration, these imports were restricted due to the pandemic. But items from these areas are still available at the grocery store. So, is it the pandemic or did the restaurant manager underestimate the traffic this week? It’s hard for me to tell.

 Only one food shortage that I have seen in the news affects the restaurant that I work in. One of the items on our menu is spaghetti. A national report noted that less spaghetti has been made in recent months because of a limit to the amount of durum wheat (used to make spaghetti). This wheat flour has been diverted into the manufacture of a pasta called bucatini. Bucatini is hollow and long, like a drinking straw. Early reports last spring suggested using bucatini instead of plastic drinking straws in order to save the planet. Looks like the idea caught on. Regular spaghetti pasta is now in short supply. "
2,journal-entry-7218," I have both good news and bad news. It all depends on how you view the happenings of the past week.

 A young man (teenage high school student) who was hired to work with us as a waiter quit. He claims that he had to go get tested for COVID 19 because he had been exposed.

The good news? The rest of us get more work hours. I can use more work hours. I need the money for bills.

The bad news? The rest of us get more work hours. We all get less time to do whatever we do when we are not working at the restaurant. We also get left wondering if he exposed us."

I am finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel."
5,journal-entry-7224,"The pandemic is affecting my life many ways -- but, in other ways, not really at all. That probably sounds like a really confusing sentence. I will try to explain...

 My grandmother turned 101 yesterday, and I am trying to stay positive and to be grateful that we were able to join the beautiful celebration for her at her assisted living via Zoom. But,  I would have done anything to have been able to see her and celebrate with her in person (and, at 101, I wonder if she will ever get to celebrate another birthday).

Besides my grandmother's birthday celebration, which was a one-time event, the way in which the pandemic most affects me on a day-to-day basis is the lack of decent childcare options. I have two little kids -- a 2-year-old daughter and a 5-month-old son -- and current circumstances have pushed me into being a stay-at-home mom. But, I am also an child psychologist in independent practice. I test patients on the weekends and spend my evenings and free moments working on reports and patient communications. It is a lot and I have been feeling very stretched thin. I love getting to spend quality time with my kids, but once we are on the better side of this pandemic and childcare becomes somewhat more accessible, I think the QUALITY of that quality time will be a lot greater. Mainly, I cannot wait to have more say over what my day-to-day activities look like, and to have more time to myself (that isn't devoted to childcare or my work as a psychologist).

In other ways, the pandemic lifestyle suits me fine -- it is even be a ""beard"" for some of my sedentary tendencies (e.g., not wanting to go outside at all on a cold or snowy day, not wanting to run errands, feeling tired and not wanting to get together with friends). My husband is AWESOME, but I know that he would love for me to be like, ""I'm going to take the baby on a long hike!"" and that is just not me. Like, at all. So,  ""safer at home"" has given me a cover for not doing certain things that I do not like to do (but feel like I should do). 

I am trying not to get too upset or too bent out of shape over things that are temporary (and hint: everything is temporary!) The pandemic is NOT forever. I am halfway to being fully vaccinated -- as a psychologist, I was able to receive my first shot last week. I do feel hopeful that things will change, for the better, before too long. I was saying to my husband the other day --  just like the Great Depression permanently shaped the people who lived through it (like my now 101-year-old grandmother), I am positive that this pandemic is shaping us too. Exactly how remains to be seen, but I am positive that it is happening."
6,journal-entry-6725," Soy una madre de 2 hijos: una niña de 12 años de edad y un niño con autismo de 14 años.  Vivo con ellos y con mi esposo. Mi trabajo es docente universitaria pero no estoy ejerciendo porque la universidad en Venezuela está paralizada, no cuento con los recursos (conexión a internet ni fondos para pagar datos móviles debido al bajo sueldo) para dictar clases. Basicamente esta es la razon por la cual la Universidad está paralizada.

 Estoy enfocada en ayudar a mis hijos en sus actividades escolares sobre todo a mi hijo con autismo de 14 años. A pesar de su condición es muy inteligente, aprende rápido y necesita mucha orientación de mi parte para prepararlo para su futura vida independiente. Sin embargo, no lo estoy haciendo y me siento culpable por ello. En este último mes de vacaciones escolares practicamente lo dejé a la deriva, le deje mucho tiempo libre y ocioso aun sabiendo que no es lo más aconsejable para él.  Siento que corre el tiempo y no esta aprendiendo las habilidades básicas para la vida. Yo en lugar de aprovechar todo el tiempo libre que tengo para apoyalo y orientarlo, prefiero dormir en las tardes o en las redes sociales, siento mucha flojera y no me dan ganas de hacer nada. Cocino porque no vamos a morir de hambre pero es muy fastidioso.

 Lo mismo me sucede con mi hija de 12 años, la estoy dejando que pase mucho tiempo en las redes sociales, por lo general vigilo lo que está haciendo pero no me esfuerzo mucho, confio en lo que hace.  Sin embargo, le propongo hacer actividades distintas y no quiere, está demasiado pegada a las redes sociales que ya para ella no existe más nada en el mundo.  Siento gran culpa de lo que esta pasando con mis hijos pero sé que debo cambiar y asumir un papel más activo en su educación "
7,journal-entry-6923," The more highly contagious strain has reached our state.

Washington state still has not gotten their stuff together about getting out the vaccine.

 When I am finally vaccinate I fear being worked to death due to being short staffed.

It will be difficult to wear a mask for a full 5 hour shift.

 Guess I’m more worried and bummed then I thought?!"
8,journal-entry-6999," It's been a few weeks since I've completed a journal entry on here. I honestly haven't known how to process much of anything the past few weeks.

 On December 17, my dad passed away. I wrote about that at length in my last entry, about how grateful I was to be able to be there, since he and Mom have been in a nursing home and he passed during a window between COVID outbreaks.

Just after two weeks later, on January 3, I got the call I'd been dreading since last March--Mom tested positive. She has asthma, Alzheimer's, and heart failure, and when she tested positive, she'd been a widow just over a fortnight. Every odd was stacked against her. When the call came, I sobbed. I wept in fear that not only would Mom be taken from us, but I wouldn't be able to be with her when she did.

The first day after her positive test, she started complaining of gastrointestinal distress--diarrhea that wouldn't stop.

This continued for several days.

But then...nothing. She retained her sense of smell and taste, although her pulse oxygen levels dipped a bit during that first week--at one point going as low as 93%, she never required supplemental oxygen. As a preventive measure, they gave her a full round of abdominal injections to prevent blood clotting. But she never developed any other symptoms.

In short, Mom kicked COVID's ass. Nearly everyone in her nursing home has tested positive, and to date, sixteen have died. But Mom didn't even have so much as a sniffle or a tickle in her throat. Toward the end of her contagious period, she'd even forgotten she had COVID. This made her confused, because staff only went into her room fully suited up in PPE (even more than what was previously normal).

 I don't really know how to process this. I'm thrilled that she is fine, of course. After losing Dad last month, losing Mom to COVID would have been unbearably painful. But this disease, which has wreaked havoc on millions of people, which has killed nearly half a million Americans alone, which is usually so incredibly dangerous for the elderly, went through Mom like it was a bad batch of seafood and nothing more.

 Is it some weird sense of survivor's guilt? Perhaps. I will say Mom's bout with COVID certainly hasn't led me to take the threat of the disease less seriously. I still mask up, wash my hands frequently, keep my distance from others, and leave the house only when necessary.

But it does have me wondering why. She already has dementia, and it's only going to get worse, unless her heart failure takes her first. Why did COVID spare her, when it's killed some perfectly healthy people, people who are much younger than her? I'm incredibly grateful that she was spared, but I'm having a hard time understanding it."
9,journal-entry-7024," I had a virtual meeting with members of the LGBT+ community and allies who participate in a hobby that plays a prominent role in my life (I'd rather not say what it is, as it's niche enough that it might identify myself or some folks in the meeting). I was so nervous, I was shaking. The culture of this hobby is relatively conservative, and gendered. I'm a trans man, and I used to do this activity as a woman. After medically and legally transitioning to male, I started doing it again, ""stealth"" (to my knowledge, others don't know that I'm not a cisgender man). I basically had to pretend I'd been trained in the activity as boy/man rather than as a girl/woman and do a lot of extra training and work all on my own, in secret.  This meeting was the very first time I had ever told other people who do this activity that I had this experience. Personally, that was earth-shattering. I learned about non-binary participants who don't really have the option to do it the way that I did, and other trans participants who did the activity through transition and therefore are very publicly doing it as trans people. I felt a lot less alone. Going ""stealth"" for anything (or especially, for everything) is an extremely lonely experience. I also felt guilty, for not doing this while openly trans, protecting myself, but missing out on the opportunity to pave a path forward for other trans and non-binary people.

 I don't think this virtual meeting would have happened without the pandemic. There are some really revolutionary changes coming on the horizon. "
10,journal-entry-7097,"The coronavirus pandemic is affecting my life in two ways. First, as an inpatient physical therapist in a large hospital, I treat this population daily,  starting with proning maneuvers in the ICU (for ARDS) to the floor level patients until discharge. It is challenging work, but it is also rewarding. I feel that I am part of history implementing new research data and reading cutting edge studies as I move along. It's like riding a wave of new information where history is being made.

 While a lot of this work is rewarding, it is also terrible. All too many times I see somebody die from this virus. Like Mary, a sweet lady in her 80's who I helped up to the chair in the ICU just so she could hear her husband's voice over the phone. She cried when he picked up on the other end. She did not worry about herself and her increasing need for oxygen, she was worried about HIS health, home alone without her. Mary passed a few days later, intubated, sedated, and alone. And there's the Vietnam vet who has survived unspeakable atrocities and now fights for every breath, proned in his ICU bed, also alone.

 Not only has this pandemic affected me in my profession, but also my personal life. I was not able to see my parents in Austria in 2020, as I had planned. They are getting older, and I know i need to see them as often as I can. I was not able to go to the gym anymore, which was my opportunity to socialize with friends and blow off some steam. I have become a homebody over this past year. This isn't as sad as it sounds. It has lead me to rediscover the simple pleasure of being at home with my loved ones and enjoy our little ""pack"" (boyfriend and two dogs). I have started to read again, have a routine of daily workouts on my Peloton after work, and enjoy new hobbies, such as playing chess.

I am typing this at work, getting ready for my shift. Today I have about 10 Covid-19 patients on my list. I look forward to seeing them, to trying to improve their lungs if even just a little, to get them out of bed to the window, or even just to bring a smile to their faces."
11,journal-entry-7136," As a mental health provider, I meet with individual adults experiencing anxiety and depression. My work has been virtual since the pandemic started. I have a number of colleagues that I meet and talk with regularly. All of us are busier than we have ever been, and are not able to see new clients. We have been able to refer clients we can't see to each other before, and now we can't. As I have reached out to widen my contacts, they are all full too.

Over the past week, I have noticed that almost all of the clients I meet with talked about being at their wits end in dealing with the pandemic. People have certainly complained about how it is impacting their lives previously, but not being at their wits end, as I have been hearing recently. Clients with young kids are feeling really cooped up and stressed about trying to care for their kids and work. Older people are feeling lonely and isolated, and everyone is sick of not being able to freely see family and friends, or just go to the movies. It is hard to hold all of this stress and anxiety, particularly when it is hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel, and when I am feeling it myself.

 Self-care is really important. I have been emphasizing this for clients and practicing it myself. For me, being outside every day has been crucial to surviving this past year, as well as having regular conversations with people I care about. I think these are the things that are helping me to manage through this difficult time."
12,journal-entry-6976," I graduated in May 2020 and I feel like I have had a sort of ""failure to launch"" that a lot of other grads have felt.

I don't know if my company will ever require in-person work again, so planning where I want to live is very open-ended."

14,journal-entry-7057," In the past week, my dad's been pushing me to get a vaccine under...less than honest pretenses. We've gotten in a few spats over it.

15,journal-entry-7065," The divisions in the country are in an uproar and racism is at the center: the white supremicists are fighting tooth and nail for what they think of as their right to dominate the rest of us. Start with Marjorie Taylor Green, the right wing star of the week (see my journal entry), continue with Kevin McCarthy's ""we all bear some responsibility for the 6 Jan attack on the Capitol and his trip to consult with Trump in Florida, continue with the hypocritical messaging of the Republicans that holding people accountable for violating their oaths of office to the Constitution is ""divisive"", continue with the posts and speeches of the people involved in the attack on the Capitol (no remorse, but the opposite), continue with the open campaign of Republicans to gerrymander so that Republicans are assured majorities, to get Republican legislatures to pass laws that allow them to override elections, watch Fox News, and watch the migration to other platforms. Continue with the astonishing failure of the Capitol police, DoD and DoJ to explain publicly what happened on 6 January, to explain how explicit warnings of armed attack failed to trigger any defense perimeters for the Capitol. Continue with the slow but steady identification of supporters, sympathizers and fellow travelers of the Poor Boys and other right wing groups inside police and other institutions. Unfortunately, we have seen all this before both in the history of the U.S. and elsewhere (Weimar Germany). May the Biden initiatives and all the Stacey Abrams style organizing be enough to hold the country together. There is a change a coming, but the resistance is fierce."

This mall so full of people, and I has too many stores. It is huge. I also went to the United State second largest mall and it is call American Dream. I went there like 7 times, 3 times to shop, and 4 times to the waterpark. I visited Philly bout

I did not like it. I also went to Six Flags like 3 times, and to more places with attractions.

18,journal-entry-7130," Can I pick one? The biggest nationally are the Congressional battle over the Covid Relief package--the Republicans are trying to shaft moderate income Americans with lower stimulus checks gauged to lower income maximums, and so far the Democrats are only doing so much to work around them, and the forthcoming impeachments, where the Democrats are pressing on, the Republicans are getting ""cold feet"" and DT's lawyers just quite on him. Just today, Pete Buttigieg was confirmed as Secretary of Transportationmaking history as the first openly gay cabinet member. But most hopefully,  the Biden administration is ""upping its game"" in getting those vaccines distributed, and closer to home, North Carolina has gone from having one of the lowest to one of the highest vaccination rates in the country. Not that the last is going to terribly speed things up for me personally, though it should certainly help."
19,journal-entry-7142,"A lot is happening at once, and I'm not sure if it's good or bad. First and foremost, Biden got another Cabinet pick -- Buttigieg -- confirmed today.  I know that the Department of Transportation doesn't have a whole lot to do with developing vaccines, but with every pick confirmed I feel less and less tense. 

Three out of four of my grandparents got the vaccine, which I'm thrilled about. Even my grandpa, who's allergic to eggs, which vaccines are grown in, is getting it, though he has to take it in a hospital where they can closely monitor him afterwards as opposed to a drive-through vaccine site. But  the way the vaccines are being distributed still make me uncomfortable. It feels like you need connections to get the shot, which shouldn't be the case. I love my grandma, don't get me wrong, but the only reason she got the vaccine is because she has a friend who has a kid who works at the hospital, and the person who works at the hospital knew that there was an open call for seniors, and called her mom who called my grandmother (whew!).

Crazy vaccine stories are all over the place. I heard of people transporting the vaccine in Oregon and got stuck in traffic, so they wandered the lines of cars and gave people shots. At Seattle University last week, the freezers shut down in a blackout -- you would think there'd be a generator -- so they put out a call for anyone and everyone to come and get shots administered. My friend's dad was in the line until 2 AM and was 30 people short of getting the vaccine.

The weird thing is, the virus doesn't impact me now as much as it used to. I double-mask while outside and not exercising now, but that's the main thing that has changed in the past few weeks. I've had to go to the supermarket without glasses because they fog up so badly when I'm wearing multiple masks -- just wandering around Safeway, hoping I bought the right food. They've detected the variants in the US, and I'm not taking any chances.

 Meanwhile, an entire city in Australia shut down over one COVID case. They've got the right idea. I wish the US had done that in the first place. We'd all be that much better off."
20,journal-entry-7208," A couple of things have occupied my feelings this week. One is my daughter's recovery. She had lost her senses of taste and smell, which seem now to have returned. Her main symptom, which has lingered, is tiredness. (I can't see it as fatigue, more just tired all the time.) Obviously the side effect of the pandemic is that I can't be with her and have to rely on phone calls to find out how sh's doing.

 The second thing is the pathetic roll-out of the vaccine here in Massachusetts. Many of my friends in other states have already gotten their second doses. I have no idea when they will make my group (over 65) eligible, nor how long I will have to wait for an appointment, or where I'll have to go. I'm really scared, living as I do in a high-risk community. This has kept me even more isolated and nervous to go out."
21,journal-entry-7194,"So much has happened not only to me this week, but also nationally as well. I think I'll start with how the pandemic is affecting me.

 Winter in the pandemic is so hard.  Especially while being in school.  I almost never go outside due to the cold, and for whatever reason my friends don't call me as often, and I have such lower energy. It's mostly due to other things in my life as well, but I had 2 panic attacks this week alone, and  I just feel like I'm losing myself.  Staying inside definitely isn't helping. 

What really makes this part of the pandemic difficult (and much more difficult than in the start) really is the weather and the winter.  When the pandemic ""began"" for us in late March, the weather was turning nicer, and I very often sat outside on my porch to do reading, and even just read outside on the grass, breathing in the fresh air, seeing the beautiful sky, flowers and greenery, and being so thankful that I lived in such a beautiful, lush place.  Even in the Fall, I would still read outside, as it was pretty warm during most of the fall. Even when it was chillier it was still tolerable enough to sit outside with a long-sleeve shirt or my flannel and read my printouts, handwrite notes or assignments, and take out my kindle to give my eyes some respite as I read my pdf textbooks. Thinking about it now, I just really miss when I would sit outside and do my linguistics homework by hand, and even listen to the lectures while taking notes outside.

 Now those are no longer options. It is Winter. It is so cold, and I'm cooped up inside. Worse yet is that the pandemic is at its worst,  and I see one of my close friends occasionally going to maskless parties, so I have to stay away from her for at least a week or more to stay safe, so I can't even see other people. There's often nights when it's especially freezing, and I have to cover myself from head to toe with my blanket to be comfortable. Before the pandemic, I was never one to pay much attention or mind to the seasons, but now I'm very attuned to them and how they affect me, especially when I can't go out in nature with a foot of snow out. When January started I was excited to go walk on a frozen lake, but now I just want it to be warm again. Maybe when I've got some free time tomorrow I should put on my snow gear and go outside after my classes are over. My sisters have been doing that, so it might be a good idea."
22,journal-entry-7198," Fortunately, many of the people I'm close to have been minimally affected by COVID, aside from socially distancing.  My husband is able to conduct his work through telehealth, and many of my friends who are in the mental health field (as I am) are able to conduct their work virtually as well. My parents are also able to work from home; there was talk of my stepfather getting laid off, but thus far that hasn't happened.

My dad got laid off early on in the pandemic (this is not unusual--he has been laid off from countless jobs) and struggled to find work. He said that he went on several interviews, but it seemed like places were just advertising that they were hiring without actually intending on hiring anybody. Certainly a frustrating situation. He was able to get hired a few months ago, though, and seems to be enjoying his new work.

 I worry about my husband's mental health. He struggles with the isolation, as well as living apart. He and I have lived apart for nearly 2 years now as we finish up our respective graduate programs. I am able to manage the distance much better than he does.  He struggles with the virtual work; he is a bit tech-averse and is fatigued by the screen time by the end of the day. He doesn't feel the same sort of connection to others virtually as he does face-to-face, which contributes to his sense of isolation. It doesn't help that the apartment he moved to several months ago is a piece of shit--falling apart a bit, roaches everywhere, you name it. He started therapy a few months ago, thank GOD.

It's hard to be in the mental health field and be married to someone who is struggling with their mental health. I know how I would respond to him if he was my client, but I feel at a loss at how to respond to him as a wife. I also feel guilty because I am coping much better. The isolation doesn't bother me, nor does the distance. I'm happy he is in therapy now."
23,journal-entry-7100," It's interesting that the country is in shambles in every possible way: economically, COVID being out of control, Biden and Harris inheriting an absolute mess in terms of managing the virus and ensuring that vaccines are sent to states constantly in order to get everyone vaccinated, and on and on and on. Yet, this morning, the day after a huge snowstorm, I saw outside my window neighbors helping neighbors, shoveling for each other, snow blowers moving straight down the sidewalk, helping numerous people. It was amazing to watch. I already knew I live in a great neighborhood, but, considering what the state of our country is right now, there is hope. It's out there, in what may seem like the smallest ways, but it is there."

It will be a more electronically connected world. I like to believe - I hope - that it will be a more socially conscious and aware world, with better safety nets and healthcare for the disadvantaged.

I can't imagine what it will be like to see my family again and hold their hands and give them hugs.

I can't imagine going through the airport and getting on an aeroplane. In all honesty, the thought gives me anxiety. But I know I will do it --- I want to do and I will need to.

 Missing my time with all my close friends. I really miss them. Phone calls just don't do it for me. If it would just be warm outside so atleast we could spend sometime together. Spring is a comments away. If we could all have the vaccine, we could end this isolation."
6,journal-entry-7064,"29 Jan. 2021. COVID Blues (in waves, logjams, and contradictory projections).

 This week a good friend, age 46, came down with COVID. On 21 Jan the daughter, age 5 or 6, tested positive. He and his wife still tested negative, but wrote: ""I feel not well today, but maybe it is just exhaustion. The whole dilemma was caused by a child in V's class, that was sent to school, even showing already symptoms. Now half of the class is infected and the classroom closed. It is insane to experience how selfish and stupid people act, even in times like this."" Four days later, Jan 25: ""We all have Covid now. V. is over it I believe. But it hit me the hardest. It comes in waves. I have hours of total fatigue and high fever, but then also some hours where it’s more or less bearable. The pain in my body is brutal. It seems to be everywhere. The doctor warned me today that it might get worse before it gets better. I can't imagine how 'worse' could look like. The lung issues often start only after 7-10 days in. So this is all in front of me. I am not qualified to receive treatment. This is reserved for people over 55...

I am on day fourth of having symptoms now. Nightmare. M. is holding up better. She was also tested positive, but her symptoms are much milder. Who knows why it got me so hard. It is scary. Especially the nights."" I put out a crowd sourcing request and got some helpful suggestions, but the main one, Redemsivir (from a biologist friend who is working on the vaccine, who also noted that the German Minister of Health just ordered 200,000 doses) is what his doctors said he was unqualified for by the state; they are saving it for the over 55 age group. Frustrating. Fortunately by late on the 26th he reported the fever broke and he thought he might be ""über dem Berg"" (out of the woods).

 Meanwhile, vaccination log jams. When Mass. entered phase 2,  checking with both my possible providers, neither had vaccine. (How this jibes with reports of vaccine sitting in refrigerators, unused or held back for second shots, is unclear. The key issue is that clinics cannot plan ahead to schedule vaccine appointments.)

 The good news. J&J finally announces today (29th Jan) their vaccine (one shot, no deep refrigeration needed): 74% effective in blocking infection (vs 95% for Moderna and Pfizer's) and 57% effective against the new more transmissible variant (but reminded that the flu vaccines are only 50% effective), and do seem to block deaths.

 The less good news: Fauci on TV warns there will continue to be new variants if we cannot get everyone (85%) vaccinated, that we will be dealing with this for the foreseable future.

 The anti-public health campaign. On television we get first hand reports about Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Georgia, Qanon supporter),  walking around Congress without a face mask, bypassing metal detectors and refusing to stop when requested by Capitol police, posting self-videos and tweets about forest fires in California being caused by Jewish lasers from space, the need to shed blood to save the country from the election of Biden, and yelling about BLM. We see a video of her walking up behind and taunting David Hogg (now 18, but a survivor of the Parkland, Fla., shooting and killing of 17 teens) -- accusing him of using kids to attack her gun rights, saying she was carrying a gun, and that he was a coward (having plenty of such experiences he refused to engage lest she get the publicity she was seeking). We see Green being offered a face mask when the Congresspeople were in a room during the attack on the Capitol, ignoring the offer. We hear of her supporting executing Democratic politicians including ""liking"" a bullet should be put in Nancy Pelosi's head. We also see video and hear Congresswoman Cori Bush describe a run in between them in the Capitol tunnel, when Green came up behind her talking loudly into her cellphone; Bush has had her office moved away from Green's and hear her yelling about Black Lives Matter (Bush had been a BLM organizer). It appears that after a very short momentary condemnation of the attack on the Capitol on 6 Jan, the Republicans are now uniting in brushing it aside and mounting a full-scale white supremacy backlash, with Minority Leader in the House Kevin McCarthy going to Mar-a-Lago to consult with Trump on next moves. When Greene does wear a mask, it is one that says ""Stop the Steal""."
7,journal-entry-7116,"So I am currently on hold, waiting to speak to the NH vaccination information line. I'm trying to find out if they will be able to move up my appointment for the second dose, to within the recommended time--at the moment it's 8 weeks out, its supposed to be 3.

 The frustration for me as an MD is realizing how much is simply unknown. I'm used to being able to look up studies or data on most things, and if the data isn't there, there's usually enough related info to take a good guess. With COVID, there just hasn't been time to do the studies, and there's simply no information. If I get a second dose of Pfizer in 5 weeks, or 8 weeks, or 12 weeks, what does that mean? Should I go back and start all over? Is it just as good? I gather (I think) that England has decided to extend the interval to 12 weeks, but based on what?

 Meanwhile, life goes on, or doesn't. There's an overall sense of ""floating,"" not entirely unpleasant, but gets old. I'd love get treatment for some minor but annoying medical issues. There are people I miss, and the social vicissitudes of telling people you now don't feel safe seeing them when you did before (because of the ore contagious variants now out there) are hard to navigate.

I'm listening to a long, detailed message for the fifth time. Giving me information that is different from what's on the website. Still on hold. But I'm glad I'm dealing with NH--if I were at home in MA, I gather it's a zoo, and it would be a long wait."
8,journal-entry-7095," Thanks for asking - terribly! There people in my life right now struggling with, and dying from, cancer. We don’t even see friends right now because it’s just too cold and we follow Fauci very strictly. (We have the luxury to be able to and we also make safe choices - like not hugging my mom just because we want to).

 It’s a cold, dark winter. I wake up several times a night. Cold dry air doesn’t help but there is this underlying sense of dread in me that is always there just beneath the surface.

 I am afraid it will never go away because I am in my mid 40’s and “it’s all down hill from here.” I know part of that is BS but seeing more people I care about get sick is very sobering. So yeah - not sleeping which makes me crankier than usual and kind of depressed. It sucks."
9,journal-entry-7067, I've eaten through my savings and the part time adjunct instructor work I was doing is on hiatus so I'm as of this month entirely without income. I'm trying not to rely too heavily on family to keep afloat and continue applying for jobs but I can't make that process go faster than it is. I'm trying to maintain a positive attitude overall and failing. I'm grateful that I don't have a ton of outside expenses but am concerned about how long I can maintain this way.
10,journal-entry-7053,"The darkness of January has set in. It's been Groundhog Day over here. No in-person fire pit nights or outdoor hangouts. It's freezing outside and I think there is fatigue. It is almost like we just want to wait until spring. I am tired of trying. I almost prefer to sit the rest out until the weather warms. So a funk for sure. Work has been busy which is great as I can dive in and just focus on that. However, the guilt sets in as I have a 5th grader at home. She is a very independent learner, but she as been lonely as I usually work part time and we can keep each other company or do stuff half the week. I am grateful that I work part time normally. It helps to keep us all sane. I can clean the toilets - that kind of thing.

However, my mind has been heavy with the terrible fact that I have three people in my life with cancer. My aunt - 62, a friend at 70 and another friend - 40's.  These people are suffering at one of the hardest times of their lives and their loved ones can't sit by them in the hospital. COVID is a nightmare. People are outside peering in windows or freezing in 17 degree weather talking to doctors because they can't be in the hospital (but are outside just in case).

 Vaccines are crazy. Its is like at the start of the pandemic when you would keep refreshing your browser to see if open slots came up for grocery delivery. I am not old enough to be eligible, but I am hearing this from everyone else. It's a really fractured and frustrating system. My parents are in their 70's and they have appointments in April (its Jan.)

 I want this to be over and I don't want to be sad and scared of death anymore. I always am to be honest, but middle age is a bitch. Add COVID and its always on the periphery."
11,journal-entry-7082," I've enjoyed writing in this journal. I like the various prompts each week that cause me to reflect on what has happened.

Every time they plan a trip out to see me and meet my partner and her kids for the first time, we have to push it back because the virus keeps getting worse. I am incredibly introverted and my partner and her kids (I love them) are incredibly extroverted. Every day I think I’ve hit my limit and want to give up. I don’t know what’s keeping me going, but I can tell that whatever it is, I’m running out of it. I’m also an alcoholic and attending AA meetings with other people had been critical. But this whole virtual thing is exhausting and soul-sucking. It takes more out of me than it gives if I go to virtual meetings. The temptation grows more and more every day."
14,journal-entry-7027,"This is an ongoing challenge, but I'm trying to stay creative in my efforts to find ways to have fun.

First, I started dancing. In private. In my attic. I put on the Doors, ""Light my Fire"" to work out to, and decided I would just rather dance. I felt so much better afterwards, like I had really moved my body in ways I hadn't for a very long time. I enjoy the opportunity the pandemic has given me to try new things in the privacy of my own home.

Second,  I started trading Game Stop. Not sure this qualifies as fun-- it's totally nerve-wracking. But I do feel like I'm both watching AND acting in a Netflix drama. And I feel very invested in seeing Wall Street crash. I want those reddit folks to strip the hedge funds dry. They deserve it.The Reddit folks outsmarted them and deserve to win.

Third,  I'm reading YA books with my 12 year old niece. We each choose a book each month and then read and discuss.

Fourth, I'm doing tons of cooking. I bought a pizza peel and pizza stone and made some delicious sourdough crust pizza the other day.

Five, I'm  playing lots of guitar. I did before, but not this much. All this time at home has helped me find new programs to practice with.

Six, last week my daughter (with whom we bubble) came over for inauguration day and we drank (Well, I drank most of it) a bottle of champagne and with her brother and their father we played card games we hadn't played since they were little (They are 21 and 25 now). We had a really good laugh.

When I was there, I realize that I don't miss that place at ALL!!! Looking at the cubicles, the furniture, the lighting, the carpets, everything... I just realize that being cooped up in that place for hours on end was like a cage or a prison and it created so much misery in my life. I praised God for this opportunity to work from home where I feel so much more human and comfortable. I realized that the office is a space of alienation where I am alienated from the rest of my life and the person I truly am. It was not a good environment for me and I praise the Lord that he found a way for me to continue working, yet not in that building."
16,journal-entry-7078," I believe the things that have changed the most since the pandemic began are the way people live and behave. It seems like many people are living in fear and suspicion. Emotions are either heightened or deadened. I don’t see much happiness or hope  around me. The vaccine promises to make everything better, but I believe it is false hope.

Since the pandemic, more people are behaving in ways that are destructive and divisive. We have seen demonstrations, looting, destruction, violence, and crime increase, even though people are told to social distance and stay home. Many, it seems, feel their rights are more important than the rights of others and try to punish others or prove themselves in destructive ways"
17,journal-entry-7048," No salgo ni a ver el correo.  La aventura diaria se reduce a sacar la basura, esporádicos viajes a la farmacia para recibir mis pastillas, algún trámite alimentario. Casi todo el tiempo leo, trabajo, juego con mi hijo o escribo, generalmente atendiendo a compromisos que me mantienen en un estado de suspensión de la realidad, esta realidad de encierro en la cual han zozobrado todos, en mayor o menor medida.

Las mañanas son lo mismo que las tardes, y las noches lo mismo que cualquier espera: todo se diluye en el tiempo que pasa a escondidas y se detiene cuando quiere, alimentando la desesperación. En todo caso, es más una urgencia, la urgencia de nada, de que el tiempo pase para que sea mañana, para continuar con la misma sensación al día siguiente, ya sin la esperanza de que desaparezca el ansia.  Porque esto ha durado tanto, que parece permanente. 

Algo de normalidad -achacada a partir del hábito que todos rompen con alegría- se ha anclado a la sensación de amargura con que caminamos de lado a lado en los pasillos de la casa, esperando que se caigan los minutos, y con ellos los días.

No hace falta hablar del peligro concreto, porque la pura eventualidad, atada a la incertidumbre como el dogal al condenado, basta para que nos consumamos, para que me consuma en el sinfín de la mente acorralada, esa vorágine terrible del pensamiento circular, obsesivo de creer que uno es el próximo, sin importar cuánto creamos y queramos que esto acabe algún día.

 Cada día camino de la cama al escritorio, de ahí al comedor y después a la cama, con intermedios en la ducha y el living. En suma, me he convertido en una rata que se acostumbró vivir en una jaula sin, sin más lugar para moverme que para acomodar la locura "
18,journal-entry-7036," My post-retirement plans, as well as those of my spouse, have been shattered by this global pandemic. All travel intentions--whether domestic or international--have been put on hold indefinitely. Despite our wealth of free time, we cannot visit distantly located family members, participate in volunteer opportunities or engage in face-to-face social interactions. Neither can we proceed with the hope of renovating aspects of our three-decades-old house, as we cannot safely hang out in home improvement stores or invite contractors to visit. The only plus afforded by the pandemic is the fact that restrictions have enabled us to eliminate many expenses and watch our savings mushroom.

Meanwhile, we grow older day by day."
19,journal-entry-7035," As a lifelong bibliophile, I have often relied upon books to buoy me through difficult times. Since March 2020, when the pandemic first began to alter all that we knew and loved, books have been my passport to safely visit people and places without mask, worry or guilt.

I have walked the streets of Paris with Chief Inspector Gamache in Louise Penny’s All the Devils Are Here, found myself quaking in a remote mountain estate in Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s creepy Mexican Gothic and assisted in solving assorted mysteries confronting a Kent retirement village in Richard Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club. Fredrik Backman transported me to a small town in Sweden in his heartwarming Anxious People, Marjan Kamali invited me to 1950s Tehran in The Stationery Shop, and Lucy Foley introduced me to a dubious cast of characters gathered on a fictional island off Connemara in The Guest List.

 Even a deadly pandemic cannot restrict travel by book nor discourage the awakening of imagination through literature."

It is tricky at first, having to put the screw in and puncture the cork,

Slowly twisting around like the way you stirred mac and chesse, and did my kinky curly hair.

 I went to your room the other day and saw your closet,

It still smells like you, Snowball the dog kept sniffing around for you.

He cries and waits for you to come home.

I am grateful to be with family you left behind.

 The news echoes and follows me around like a shadow,

Constantly reminding me of how you died, how I never even got to say goodbye.

Your death certificate came in today.

I will pick up your ashes tomorrow.

I miss you so much grandma "
21,journal-entry-6950,"I think it definitely reconfirmed the general sentiments of America kind of being a undeveloped nation with the guise of being developed, or as people like to say, a third-world country wearing a Gucci belt.

22,journal-entry-7004," Right now, I think I'm most frustrated by inefficient vaccine distribution in the U.S. It's not even that I disagree with who is prioritized. I have my thoughts, of course, but I think there's no truly fair way to decide who should get it first and the CDC's recommendations are at least reasonable. But doses of the vaccines are going to waste, and that's infuriating because there's no justifiable reason for wasting a prophylactic that can save so many lives. It's not the fault of any single person. It's an institutional failure, and so much more could have been done to plan for this issue. We've been in the pandemic for almost a year. There has been more than enough time to put together a functional program for distributing the vaccine.

 Some individuals that I do consider to be at fault, though, are the people who are cutting the line. Wealthy individuals who are traveling out of state or out-of-country in order to secure doses for themselves. These are people who already have every advantage - jobs that allow them to work from home instead of putting themselves at risk, savings enough to cover no-contact delivery of anything they could possibly want, and working health insurance in the event that they are infected. I understand the desire to protect yourself and your family. But it's absolutely despicable to cheat the system in order to gain an advantage. This pandemic has shown, more than anything, that human depravity has no bounds."

Luego vinieron 7 meses de confinamiento en los que prevaleció el miedo, la incertidumbre y las pérdidas en muchos sentidos. El 1 de octubre volvimos lentamente a salir. Lo hacemos con restricciones y precaución.

A pesar de todo ello, tengo mucho por qué agradecer.  Agradezco que estoy viva, que los seres humanos que más me importan en la vida están vivos. Agradezco que he sobrevivido a mi propia historia, que he soportado con dignidad y decencia mi propia misión en este mundo. Agradezco que aunque mi alma fue arrasada hasta los cimientos, estoy de pie, sigo avanzando, no me doy por destruida en definitiva. Agradezco lo largo y lo ancho de mi amor, ese que se expande, y envuelve como una sombra a un sin fin de gente que poseen tesoros que admiro: generosidad, valentía, entrega, compromiso, aplomo, verdad, rebeldía, perseverancia, misericordia, lucha...

 Agradezco por lo pequeño y por lo grande; por lo simple y lo complicado; por lo trivial y lo importante.  Agradezco el trabajo que es pasión, que es creación, que construye y aporta a la vida de otros. Agradezco que aún encuentro ternura para escribir y comunicar. Agradezco que lo más importante ha quedado intacto dentro de mí.

Siempre que aparece el agradecimiento en mi vida, surgen los pequeños demonios de la suficiencia, hubiera querido hacer más y mejor. Hubiera querido tener más manos, más voluntad, más recursos. Pero todo lo hecho fue con corazón y buena voluntad.

Agradezco a todas las personas que me apoyaron y decidieron estar presentes en mi vida. También a aquellas que desde el anonimato me dedicaron una oración o hicieron lo posible para que la oscuridad no me devorara. Sé que fue difícil apoyarme, sé que lo hicieron contra todo, sé que el haber creído en mí me ha mantenido con vida.  Muchas gracias. De verdad, a todos, muchas gracias "
24,journal-entry-6969," The news about worsening coronavirus news/statistics, and increasing requirements for overseas travel had made me feel anxious at times especially with my husband’s insistence of traveling to the Philippines this year after we have gotten our vaccination.

Being cooped up in the house, I have spent time searching for new recipes, learning about gardening, mobile wifi, and Korean on YouTube, and studying Financial Accounting on Coursera. I am pleased that browsing on YouTube, I learned how to extend the battery usage on my phone.

We also need to check in to cafes and restaurants either mandatory writing names and phone number down or check in through our Safe WA app.  It has become the new normal, and if it helps keep Covid 19 under control then it is something we just keep on doing here in Perth, Western Australia.

Social distancing became the new norm but I feel we are becoming very complacent, we also were told recently to stock up on face masks too. So I feel we are waiting for the other shoe to drop so to speak.

 How does the EU think that it is at all appropriate to be playing around with the idea of not sending vaccines to the UK? Yes, Brexit is shit. And they are angry --- but play with something that is not as essential right now.

4,journal-entry-6888," Last weekend E. and I took E. to the airport: he is beginning his active duty tour supporting the air guard’s COVID vaccination efforts. While I admit it’s nice to have some space to breath -we were both working from home and we only like in 1,200 square feet!-  taking care of a house and an toddler by myself is exhausting, even with daycare and the cleaners coming this week! I forgot how stressful it is to have to decide on and prepare a meal every day—I guess I’d better get back on that meal planning bandwagon. Thankfully we get a lot of support from our little bubble. E. misses daddy a lot already and is very demanding when we chat over FaceTime—she is obsessed with seeing the bathroom in his hotel room. We prepared a few weeks in advance, telling her he was going to go help people; she started too respond that she likes to help and wanted to go too, so I tell her I need her to stay and help mommy. So far she is satisfied with that answer and she does try to help me by picking up her toys and getting towels to wipe up spills both real and imagined.

 [He] did get the vaccine right away and I’m grateful for that. Our bubble friend who works out of his home part time also got one, thank goodness. The county says they plan to start vaccinating teachers at the end of this month, perhaps because our governor has decided in person school must resume March 1. I hope that means E.’s daycare teacher will get one soon but honestly just looking at the weekly supply numbers and the size of our various priority groups I don’t see how it is possible for teachers to be vaccinated in time. I am worried for our teachers—worried for their health, and worried that the great teachers in our country will chose to retire or leave the district rather than risk their lives."

I'm taking 5 classes (and 1 weekend lab course in April) so I planned to drop a class after I got a feel for them anyways.

 Something positive I did do though is I just scheduled a telehealth consultation for mental health through my university's mental health services! Ever since my dad was laid off in late April, I haven't been able to see my therapist because of the cost, and it's been really difficult trying to identify a therapist to call who accepts our new State Medicaid insurance. I've always found therapist in the past through referrals, so this time has been really difficult and I haven't found one yet or even have the energy to call some. I'm hoping that the mental health consultation will lead to me getting in contact with a therapist at my university's mental health services department, as even though I've heard not so great things about them, something is better than nothing and it could guide me in the right direction.

I just been feeling so angry and slightly depressed and honestly I feel like I have a lack of sense of direction and I feel like I've become disconnected from myself.

Telephone consults have been the normal since last March, and proves to be great for some things, but leads to some things being missed like simple observations being recorded for the patient.

 Tested negative for CoVID, but post infection fatigue causing all sorts of strange symptoms similar to the long term symptoms some have called Long COVID, so now medics say maybe I’ve actually had CoVID. I don’t think I have.

Long CoVID and indeed any post infection fatigue seems to be dismissed as one of those things, and no real universal support, or advice offered.

 I have found my own resources and explanations and theories by reading around the area of post infection fatigue and links to Long CoVID. All very helpful, as I have a medical background and I can do this- feel very sorry for those that [can't] access this good help and advice. Been a game changer last few days.

Read a lot on the theories on physiology and on treating ME, and post viral & post infection fatigue, and it being similar to Long CoVID. This has given me ways to plan, pace and manage my strange symptoms of fast heart rate, extreme fatigue episodes, caffeine intolerance, body fizzing sensations and times where my body can’t regulate its temperature. Learning to read these as signs to rest, and recover. Acceptance is key to the slower pace and time off work.

Taking this tragedy at face value, no thank you would be one ugly mug of a murderer, but taking what we've learned though it and growing from it. The forest gains nutrients from the fallen trees, so let's take a note out of nature's book, and we shall honor the lives of those we've lost and grow towards the sun. This can tend to feel like it's a personal stance about how Covid has directly affected me, where that's the whole problem. We are supposed to do this together, if aliens came down and attacked us we would all be fighting as one race and a united world. Well this is a virus, alien to us and we are as divided as ever. Arguing about how a mask doesn't let us breathe, well how about the millions of people who can't breath because the air is too polluted or because they already died due to some people not wearing a mask. But I digress, for me this week that pandemic has limited my ability to go to the library to research some books that would cost way too much otherwise. Now this is a personal choice to stay home and stay safe and healthy, not to infect anyone else or myself. My method of research is less analog than it has ever been, my art more digital and my notes electrical.

A new President has been inaugurated, and he and his team are starting to make substantive changes in the way the country will handle the pandemic going forward. There are new challenges, vaccine supply and worrying new virus variants, and yet it now feels like we might have a fighting chance.

Luego de esto, no hemos buscado apoyo, ni orientación. Nos hemos mantenido aislados. La Municipalidad de la ciudad tiene centros de apoyo respiratorio, pero no los hemos usado porque no hemos tenido indicios de tener la enfermedad.

 Toda la orientación proviene de los medios de comunicación y de las redes sociales."
13,journal-entry-6875,"The coronavirus pandemic has affected my life in the past week. My dad goes grocery shopping to stock up on food. My family has been avoiding crowds. My family also avoids taking public transportation. I miss seeing family and friends. My family has had to cancel travel plans. I plan on traveling in a couple of years. My family only goes out if they need to pick up medicine, go to the doctor, or pick up food for dinner (e.g. pizza every Friday). Quarantine was hard for me at first. I didn't understand why people had to stay home. My parents told me that COVID-19 was starting and everyone around the world has to go on quarantine (lockdown or isolation in other parts of the world). I'm more used to quarantine. I try not to get stressed and have mood swings. I stay calm by deeply inhaling and exhaling. I connect with friends from high school and college on Facebook. I want the world to go back to normal so people can see each other and travel again."

15,journal-entry-6870,"Honestly, up until quite recently, [this] project has served as a pretty good substitute for seeing my therapist. It's been a really great tool to say what's on my mind without worrying about somebody judging what I have to say, and having a short period of reflection every week was quite helpful. More recently however, I've been feeling the need to actually speak with a mental health professional, since venting your feelings can only get you so far. Luckily, I just made an appointment for a mental health consultation with my university's student mental health services, and I'm hoping that will connect me with a therapist that takes my new State insurance."

17,journal-entry-6896,"My whole entire facebook is full of videos of pleas from medical staff, from people who have lost loved ones etc...and I see people comment and like and share acting as though they have understood that this is horrific and that they should follow the rules, but then go and break the rules just after watching it. I go for my daily exercise around parks and its instantly ruined by the amount of people outside. I do know we need exercise but you wouldn't even know a pandemic was happening. What will it take? What is it actually going to take for people to take this seriously? Is it to make it clear how many thousands of people have lost their lives? Should we have daily debriefs on the news again to really hammer it into people's heads about the rules and for these rules to be enforced? Why aren't we being more strict and actually staying in our homes? I cannot believe that the UK government is even compromising the rules by saying one thing but allowing another thing that contradicts the rules itself. I think it's really pathetic and selfish if people think their freedom is being compromised- we can still be democratic but have enforced strict rules for a small time scale which we should of had way back at the start and maybe it would not have lasted so long. But, that's the problem with the UK isn't it? That we think we have that freedom - because yes we do- but how can you sit there and talk about the greatness and unity of the country that when it actually comes to something like this pandemic everyone has turned out to be selfish and not thinking about the greater good and at a cost of that so many people have lost their lives. And the economy? We literally made up the economy, do you really think we have to go get a burger and a pint to save it? I wish people would see past the lies and see the bigger picture that we need to properly lockdown like NO movement whatsoever because we are the reason it is spreading- how has the UK only NOW closed its boarders and you can only enter with a negative test!? This is not the time to relax even with the vaccine rolling out. People are acting as if this is the new normal which it is not, we are far from anything being normal.

And you know know what the craziest thing is, is that I am asking these questions still LITERALLY A YEAR after its all began."

I am often a week behind, sometimes I don’t know what to say but I keep showing up.

I know he’s right, rationally, but we’re both older and frankly at the rate the US is going, or multiplying days might be over before we can slow the virus down, much less eradicate it. I actually love the idea of a totally private pregnancy. As much as I enjoyed showing off my belly, the long commute to and from work was terrible (especially having to pee ALL THE TIME) and I was nervous to tell anyone (not too soon, not too late....). Also, working from home more when I have to pump during the day?! Yes please!! Anyway even if I could convince him to see things my way, now he’s out of state helping the guard run vaccine clinics at least through March so I guess we all have at least a few more weeks to think (obsess) about it..."
21,journal-entry-6857,"This has been a hard week. Two years ago I befriended a homeless woman on my street. She became a good friend and we spent a lot of time talking and hanging out. She died the other night on the sidewalk alone in the cold. She may have had COVID-- the results of her autopsy won't be ready for another six months. It breaks my heart because she could not go anywhere to get warm because everything was closed because of the virus-- also the shelters weren't safe. Her daughter wouldn't even come to visit her. It is heartbreaking. Even if she didn't die from the virus, I feel that she was killed by the virus in that she was blocked from all the human contact that sustained her-- even her counselor and social worker no longer saw her. How many people must be in her situation? This is the psychological toll of the pandemic."

Like definitely a harbinger of evil, but she was so funny because of how awful she was as First Lady. Like, I didn't even know that was a job you could mess up with.

 I felt relief waking up and seeing Trump fly away like a villain fleeing the scene of a crime, and while I was upset that we're paying for his trip to his club, I'm just happy he's ""gone"". But I don't feel relief. I enjoyed the ceremony, I mean Lady Gaga performed *performed*. She was ready. But it's not like a whole new world. I guess normalcy is the goal, but what does that even mean anymore?

1,journal-entry-6787, I don't really feel like people in my community has been supporting one another during this coronavirus pandemic because i haven't heard or seen anything good so far in my community how i see others be helping eachother and more but so far nothing much.
2,journal-entry-6774," My boss tested positive.

 I am so glad that I insisted when we were in the office, he sat in his office with the door shut and everything has spoken was over the phone. I am glad that I called out that he was coughing. I am glad that he decided to stay home the next day. I am glad that I decided I need to work from home. And so it has been 9 days since I was even in the same building as him.

But that is still scary. It was so close. He didn't feel ill. He thought I was being sensitive but was ok with that. I don't know what I would have done if it was me --- I worry for my husband, and even more so for my father in law.

 The law here in the UK that won't give the second dose of the Pfizer until 12 weeks is still making me mad. What makes me even angrier is that some GP's were allowed to take it in their discretion to give it or not, and my father in law's decided they were ok with this new rule. I do think that it is immoral to change a dose on people without knowing the side effects. I think it is immoral to change the dose on people after they agree to the original plan, and not give them a say. They are doing this in an immoral and unethical way - and I feel helpless in creating a change. I will write to my MP. I hope he will write to him. I want to call out to all those in the UK to write to their MPs to stop this process.

And then I think about New Jersey (USA), where my 96-year-old grandmother can't get an appointment for a vaccine. Where my 65-year-old mother, who is a teacher can't get a vaccine, and her words are 'they changed the system so smokers get a vaccine before teachers' and teachers have to be in the classroom; have to go to work; have to interact with others. My father who is also 65, who has many comorbidities also can't get one.

 So I sit here worrying about myself, my family, my loved ones, the world.

 And then I am thankful and recognize my privilege. I have a job. I can work from home. I get my groceries delivered to my house."

I've had such a hard time staying focused on normal life, on a hair trigger for some earthshattering breaking news. It's like a paranoia, like being in pitch-black, remote woods in the dead of night, knowing that something dangerous is out there, flinching at every snap of a twig. I'm so exhausted waiting for the next news story to send me into that two-part phase of shock, at first, and then the crash from the shock. I know I should focus on the day-to-day, because there's nothing I can really do about those kinds of news stories. Since March, I've felt braced for something terrible, and never really been able to fully detach and relax."
5,journal-entry-6763," This journal has been a way for me to process, to relate, to empathize with those who are similar and different from me at the same time. It has been a joy to just write and create. I find myself listening to understand the perspectives that are different than mine.

As though experience can be leverage to understand what reality means to you in times of uncertainty.

I got to watch people awaken, challenge contemporary notions of white supremacy by meeting people where they are at.

 I learned to stand up for myself and know that it is okay to be overwhelmed, to be broken, to lean into my family and friends.

This journal has helped me find a way to connect with others without ever getting to meet them.

To reflect in my own humility with the stories that others have to share.

For that, I am truly grateful.

 I often tell myself as a figure skater before competition that all the people in the stands are friends I have yet to meet or make. To be honest, I feel the same way about people here, friends, strangers, essential workers, humans who I have yet to connect with."

10,journal-entry-6727," I haven't had COVID, but my sister did in the fall in September or October I think. I remember I was so scared for her when she said she tested positive. I live on the East Coast and she lives in Montana, so we don't live very close to each other. We can't just go and visit each other without some extensive planning. Thank goodness she ended up being okay. She described it as having a really bad cold and then suddenly lost all energy. But, she was able to recover at home without going to the hospital. Last month (December) she was saying her sense of taste is still really off. She said she often has to ask her sons to double check how something tastes in the fridge because when she goes to eat something it will taste really off, or like it's gone bad.

 I also have two friends who believe they had COVID prior to when testing was available, so they really don't know if they had it. And the tests to see if you have the antibodies really aren't very reliable. One of them caught it in January towards the end of a vacation to India and she was very sick. She described it as being the sickest she's ever been and she lost her sense of taste. My other friend believes she got it the end of February and she felt like she had a horrible case of the flu and one of the sickest she's ever been. I know she said that it really affected her breathing. But, again, both of them caught it before they could be tested for it, or before anyone even know how widespread it was even here in the U.S.

 I'm very thankful that my loved ones who caught this virus made it through okay, but I know there are so many others who have not been so fortunate. It is one of my biggest worries and a great source of anxiety."

I have a ten minute zoom gathering planned for tomorrow with random people to raise a toast to our new administration. And cheer that four years of this national nightmare are OVER!!! And celebrate the ascension of our first female, Black, Asian Vice President!!  We are going to have a group scream over Zoom. It will be cathartic and healing. And then we will pop the champagne and drink heartily together.

 I know there is SO Much more to do re the vaccines and masks and the economy and getting people back to work. But still: We need to stop and celebrate the moments that mean something. I live close to the Capitol and am sad I can't attend the inauguration. It's a wonderful event, to be in the crowd with so many like minded people, and I know this one would have been amazing because of Kamala Harris. I went to the Obama inauguration and it was so moving to see so many proud people, to be part of social change going in the direction we want. Anyway, there's a pandemic. And loony white supremacists lurking around. So we'll watch it on TV. And cheer from home.

 Around me, people are worried, anxious that something horrible will happen tomorrow. I don't think so. I think the worst has passed with regard to the protests and the Capitol.

 Meanwhile, we have two young men from India who just arrived on Friday, direct from Delhi, staying in our airbnb, and they are so lovely. We text every day, and they have just offered to make us Indian food!! I am going to make them some sort of American cake--maybe banana bread? I realized just now I could focus on the fact that we can't sit down and have a meal together, or I can focus on the fact that two complete strangers from halfway around the world just showed up at my house and are eager to share their culture with me and eager to receive from us.

 You can focus on the division and hate, or you can focus on all the people who want to make connections and build a better world.

That's where I'm placing my energy right now."
13,journal-entry-6699,"January 14, 2021

 Since I have been working in kitchens and restaurants, weekdays and weekends are the same thing. Every place that I have worked so far has been open seven days per week.

 A typical day for me means that I get up, eat breakfast and dress for work. I hop in the car and I drive to where I work. I slap on a mask, punch in on the time clock and wash my hands. I start to work, and I don’t stop until the shift is over. For me, my shift usually covers the preparation and service for one meal in the day. After the shift, I get back in my car, take off my mask and go home. Not much in this schedule has changed since the pandemic began.

 The biggest change in the day is the requirement to wear a mask. A mask can make it difficult for me to communicate because it muffles my voice. I also find it hard to understand coworkers who are wearing masks because their voices are also muffled and their faces are covered. I also find myself using hand sanitizer a lot more. I have to wear gloves all the time now, where the previous standard for food service workers in my state says that you can have your hands bare if you do not touch the food (just the dishes or any wrappers). The change in policies regarding gloves is strange, because the restaurants I have worked in previously considered wearing gloves in the dining room in front of customers to be a signal to the customers that the restaurant (or the customers themselves) were somehow unclean, so bare hands were sometimes preferred.

 The biggest change in the food industry is the overall instability. Production facilities and restaurants in the area are constantly looking for employees as more people get sick or opt to stay home out of the craziness."
14,journal-entry-6703, This week I aged out of my mom’s health insurance plan. It is scary to navigate and fortunately I am able to qualify for medic-aid from the state. It’s also difficult because I have a disability and a lot of the treatment I was able to have was because of my mom’s insurances now I have to start all over with the process and it is backed up because of the pandemic. Then I got to thinking that at least I have the privilege to have those options. There are some people who don’t even have that choice. In the midst of the pandemic I question how many people have passed away because they couldn’t go to the hospital for fear of the insane amount of medical bills one may acquire. It’s so unfortunate and unfair that one has to be put in that predicament.
15,journal-entry-6647," This question almost feels like a joke because I think the answer is pretty obvious, with the biggest news story this week being the breach of the capital. As more details emerge like the claims of Congresspeople giving reconnaissance tours of the Capitol, plans to assassinate officials like the vice president, and evidence pointing towards riot being intentionally planned instead of just spur of the moment really are shocking and I can't believe it.

It's been interesting to see the right-wing media's response to the event, because I really believe they were just as much a contributor to this riot is everyone else like the president and other politicians who were accused of inciting the violence. The day after the riot I I watched Fox news with my grandmother and they immediately started doing damage control, separating those who write it and broke into the capital from other Trump supporters.

However, what didn't sit right with me as how they kept bringing up that the riot ""wasn't as bad"" as the nighttime riots that occurred in the summer during the black lives matter protests, which seems ridiculous to me. It's like the whole ""but her emails"" argument all over again but this time with something more important going on."

17,journal-entry-6687," Last year's Thanksgiving Dinner at church was cancelled, or course! It was one of the highlights of my year. I don't think that we will be able to have it this year, either. Take-out boxes are a poor stand-in for the camaraderie that we experienced.

 The family reunion was cancelled, as well. We are trying to organize one via Zoom, hoping that August might allow a gathering. The vaccine rollout seems hampered, and I wonder if that will even come to pass.

 So many people are missing the traditional milestone gatherings; baby showers, bridal showers, weddings, proms, graduations, and funerals, we must find other ways of gathering. Sporting events, homecomings, the list goes on. Much of the fabric of our community lives has been ripped away!"
18,journal-entry-6686," The loneliness creeps up on me. It appears out of left field. The desire to just go and hang out with friends, go out to eat, even browse stacks at the library. The library is closed and books are available for remote order and self pick up by appointment only. Work is still like a ghost town. We are beginning to get the first wave of people looking for help to avoid evictions. Our CARES Act funding is gone. We are hoping that a new relief bill will provide more funding as well as extend the eviction moratorium. What is demoralizing is that COVID or not, some landlords are getting around the moratorium by charging lease violations. I have a friend that had to find another home to rent because her landlord didn't tell her he was in foreclosure and had a short sale closing in 21 days!

 I am still doing housing inspections by Facetime. Lease-signing still is in person, but the contacts are kept very brief. We were encouraged to work from home on the 20th. I decided to take a vacation day and celebrate my son's birthday by cooking shrimp scampi and his favorite chocolate cake.

 I am woefully amazed at the selfishness of some legislators who adamantly refused to wear masks when sheltering from the violent assault on the Capitol. One of my representatives tested positive as a result. His whole family is in quarantine. You can't know how vulnerable someone is , or perhaps someone in their household is, by looking at them. I can't wrap my brain around how many people have been so duped. I was horrified that the Confederate Flag was used in the assault. As a nation, we are still experiencing the aftershocks of Reconstruction backlash. Just look at the disparities in health outcomes. We had health officials blaming minorities for having preexisting conditions that make them more likely to have severe COVID and die, when the structure and funding of our health care system (?), Big Agra, and trauma also contribute.

I went on a novel-reading frenzy as soon as I was done with finals last semester... Classes start back up on Tuesday, with one class in hybrid format (1.5 hours Zoom Live and 1.5 hours in person). I hope they don't cancel that class again. This is the third semester I have tried to enroll in it, and it is the last class I need before internship.

 My anxiety is like a low-grade fever. Just enough to be uncomfortable, not enough to paralyze. I am finding ways to connect with people. I found a book discussion forum for mental health professionals that was very fulfilling and encouraging."

What will happen if I get it?

Apparently, according to one thing I read 1 in 30 in London has COVID. It is just coming closer and closer.

 In a sick way, I hope I just get it already, so I don't have to be afraid.

20,journal-entry-6608,"I finds it ironical that the writing entries recently have really had little to do with the pandemic and much more about the political goings on. As I wrote last week I was on an uptick because the democrats from Georgia had won the runoff for the two seats in the senate. Then on the very same day after I had submitted my happy thoughts the worst insurrection happened. I had intended to spend a quiet afternoon reading but caught the beginning of the invasion. From then on my quiet afternoon declined to a drama that I never could imagine seeing. Where were the police, the secret service, the troops, anyone for help? It keeps hitting me that the POTUS was safely sealed in the White House while the second and third persons in power along with all of our governing body was under siege. As time passes it becomes even scarier because it seems that there were plenty of indicators that something was about to happen which went ignored. Our systems had failed and the evidence reeks of the possibility of some inside help. I hope that our systems of policing and justice actually work to unwind this and quell it quickly and eliminate it forever.

 The suspense continues on the political front as the pandemic takes a back page  in the news.Unfortunately more failure has arisen on that front with another system failure. It seems that the United States is incapable of vaccinating its population expediently. Where is competent leadership to get this going smoothly and efficiently so that no doses are squandered? Right now there is little outrage over this and plenty over the issue of getting rid of a failed and mentally deranged president. I’m anxious on both accounts."

I don't go to movies or concerts or plays or anything like that either. I actually like my social life better now than pre-pandemic. I find that hanging out with friends is more focused on conversation and just ""being"" rather than ""doing stuff"" all the time. I feel like I'm getting to know people on a deeper level since we aren't all distracted by the particular activity we are doing. For fun I have also been doing yoga in Central Park which is wonderful and then walking with friends. At home, I have done a few jigsaw puzzles which I enjoy and I hadn't done in a long time."

I keep hearing that it can take months or a year till we all get vaccinated but the sad part is we are not fully sure this vaccine can work as of now it;s okay but i would just like everything to go back to normal and everyone to stop worrying so much about this pandemic,"

I know I went somewhere, but it was nearby and in a secluded cabin we left only once to walk. At this point, I don't want to get sick but I moreso don't want to spread sickness more.

 Now members of congress are getting sick from hiding last week, which is a horrible follow-up to what happened. Members of my extended family who have said the whole pandemic is a hoax have started getting sick.They're carrying on with life as normal  as much as they can, which is really horrifying. All to prove a point. I don't get it. "
25,journal-entry-6611," When the pandemic is over, we'll be living a new normal. It is likely that wearing masks will be part of our lives for years to come; it is likely that social distancing will only gradually diminish. It is likely that much of the technology that helped us to connect during the pandemic will remain: churches may continue to reach beyond their communities via Zoom; options for virtual learning will enhance education at all levels; technology will remain vital to keeping families and friends connected.

 There's plenty that I cannot picture: using mass transportation; travel in cities or outside our country; spending an overnight in a hotel or motel; crowded bleachers during a sports event; being part of a theater audience; dinner at a special restaurant.

May aspects of our pandemic lives remain: deepened appreciation for everyday moments; renewed appreciation for time with family and friends; heightened awareness of Mother Nature's bounty and beauty.  May we cling to all that reminds us of the gift of life and the importance of celebrating everyday joys."
1,journal-entry-6610," Can I possibly separate coronavirus from politics this week? No! The assault on our country's capitol was shameful and frightening. It is difficult to understand the fear (or motivation) that caused so many to engage in an uprising against our government. It is painful to know that our country is so divided and that citizens are so angry that they would resort to lawlessness. It is hard to imagine being able to heal as a country. How will we bridge that divide going forward?

 All that pain has taken attention from the pandemic while adding layers of worry, hurt and fear to what we're already shouldering. The vaccine is becoming available; there is light at the end of the tunnel. Unfortunately, our spirits are not lifted. We must be deliberate about finding hope. We must do our part to move out of the darkness and to take on responsibility for finding -and working toward- the light."
2,journal-entry-6612, Pandemic is on the back burner for me right now as I'm mostly disturbed by the attack on the Capitol last week and the fear that more attacks are planned. Yesterday I took a walk along Madison Ave. in NYC and it made me sad to see so many empty stores. I hadn't walked along there in a while and so it was surprising to see how many shops had gone out of business. This made me quite sad and also  made me wonder whether NY is going to make it through this...
3,journal-entry-6592," It hasn't affected me too much, here in Perth Western Australia, the Premier has everything as controlled as can be. We have though have been strongly advised to stock up on masks, as well as wear them traveling by plane interstate or around Western Australia. The UK Covid 19 has gotten into Australia and so just keeping up with advice from health professionals. I have downloaded app on my phone to check into all cafes, restaurants and shops throughout Western Australia. In event of outbreak will be able to track where we have been.

I feel safe,but also more aware of hygiene practices and not getting too close to people. Disinfectant surfaces I touch as well as my hands, as well as not touch my face either.

I realize too we never get rid of the virus, but to just be aware of it. Still have anxious moments when in public, but that is probably due to shutdown last April 2020."

We’ve been explaining [...] that daddy has to go away to help people and he’ll be back. Hopefully we’ll be able to establish a FaceTime schedule that we can all look forward to.

If all the states go to age 65+ then hopefully all of our parents will be vaccinated in the near future. This will be a huge relief, although I am worried about what will happen if they don’t get the second doses in there recommended 3 or 4 weeks. Eric says that for most vaccines it doesn’t matter if you push out the booster, but these are totally new vaccines and I worry what if all these people - our folks included- end up not properly protected? What if a ton of people decide not to come back at all for their second dose and we’ve effectively wasted their first doses that could have gone to someone who would have completed the regimen? Although I guess that’s always a possibility anyway."

8,journal-entry-6558,"I feel full of rage, sadness, and empty.

 My grandmother passed away from Covid. Words cannot begin to describe the amount of pain I feel from her sudden passing.

 Over the past three days, she is the tenth person who I have seen die from Covid. I just found out a few more close friends are hospitalized for Covid-19. It makes me wish I could have it so they could live. I actually did have it back in March 2020 but I was lucky, I only had a mild case and was able to move forward.

 I just feel angry at times. Angry at how people are taking this as a joke and it comes  at the cost of human lives. It makes me wish that anyone who decides not to wear a mask in public can die from Covid-19 so that maybe the pain of their loss will slap some sense into those around them.

The Christian in me says to forgive them, to not wish hatred and violence but love them. But my mind can't stop replaying me screaming at people or wishing them death for their ignorance.

My friend told me, will this bring your grandmother back? No, but I just get so upset at the complexities of this pandemic. Why should I show compassion and care for White Nationalists who in the past have screamed the N word at me, have threatened myself as a queer woman of color, who have caused so much generational trauma. Part of me keeps thinking, why would I ever want to forgive someone who does nothing but spread hatred and pain? My religion may say one thing and yet my heart keeps aching from the reality I live in.

I know I can forgive people over time but this has reached a new level of unacceptability. I almost wish we could have another Civil War since to be honest they never got over losing and it has been the sleeping giant awakened with a vengeance slowly stalking us like hazy nightmare. But once again, this would not solve the root of the issue.

The real solution in my opinion is education, love, and empathy. We have to do better. What will be left of us after this otherwise?"

10,journal-entry-6562," Where. To. Start! The terrorists in my country forcing their way into the U.S. Capitol Building is nearly unspeakable because so many thoughts and feelings flood to mind/body that it's the ultimate traffic jam. Many knew the threat. Those in leadership either requested support which was denied or supported the threat. Residents in this country are split among those who are surprised (white folk) and those who aren't (BIPOC). Credible threats are mounting for Inauguration Day. Good god, please don't let another tragedy happen. No doubt our national leadership will try to move forward and past rather than pause to reflect, fix/heal, and then move onward. I fear what will come from that. For a moment, pandemic news has taken a backseat, but there has been no respite from anxiety, only trading the cause.

 I was registered for a grad course this spring semester. I dropped it just hours ago. I will not take a course this semester. I see so many things cluttered, unfinished, in need of attention in, around, and about my house. I feel bad enough that I've been working from home for 10 months now and accomplished little on a long-standing and lengthy to-do list. I know the spring will bring added yard work. If I feel this bad now, I worry what I'll feel like at the end of the pandemic if I don't accomplish substantially more. So, I am putting grad school on hold for a semester (at most, I hope, but I promise myself nothing), and I will commit myself to spending non-work time one of two ways: regaining an exercise routine which was lost due to my inability to easily pivot since the onset of the pandemic, and accomplishing all the long-standing items on my household to-do list."

12,journal-entry-6508,"We are in touch with family and friends throughout the country.

As a person who lives alone, she has learned during pandemic self-isolation that she wants to move from her home to a senior community for more opportunity for social interaction. She has been unable to explore options due to COVID restrictions. Our friends in Georgia feel excited by a drive-thru trip to Starbucks. Our grandchildren in Virginia have not been in school since March; they've added a pandemic puppy to their lives. Our friends with a second home on Block Island have been limiting their visits due to COVID restrictions and frightening infection rates.

The list can go on, but the theme remains the same. Friends and family have stepped back from all that was 'normal' in order to protect themselves and others. Life has been put on hold. We're somewhat like the movie Groundhog Day - each day is the same as the one before and will continue to be the same tomorrow. Acute became chronic, and chronic is not fun.

At the same time, the political violence and uncertainty in the US is unsettling; again, I give thanks for so many reasons that I'm not living there at this particular time in history, but am worrying anew about family who are stuck in red states there. So am also looking forward to turning the political page and hopefully moving to better control the virus and finally see those statistics change for the better."

I wonder how they’ll adjust to being college students again. Will it be hard to fit into campus life after being on their own? Will they have drifted apart from their friends? And my daughter - how will this interlude affect her post-college life? She’s working delivering meals on wheels in the mornings, and babysitting in the afternoon. Good work that she enjoys, but not the experience she was hoping for. They seem happy enough right now, and their well-being is a high priority for me.

18,journal-entry-6543," Thursday, January 7, 2021 – What.The.F**k.Was.That?! That’s a post I saw in reference to yesterday’s extraordinary events when Trump egged his supporters on to literally trash the Capitol building as both houses were meeting to certify the election results in favor of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. It was the most insane thing I had ever seen in US politics and I’m sixty as of last December 21 so I’ve seen Watergate, Iran-Contra, the End of the Cold War, 9/11, and the 2003 American invasion of Iraq. Not since 9/11 has the country been so completely rattled.

I’m working on my syllabus during the AM yesterday, aware the certification was going to happen, also fully aware that Trump supporters were planning to rally in DC. I’d been reading about their plans to converge on the capital to support Trump and to disrupt the certification process because of his egregious lies about having won the election. Talk about living in an alternative reality! I’d also read articles that quoted the DC law enforcement saying they were ready for the protests. And R texted that AM that DC stores were once again boarding up in anticipation of riots and violence.

But I wasn’t too worried as the certification was a foregone conclusion, even with the Dirty Dozen senators planning to challenge various state certifications, along with their cowardly, traitorous allies in the House. The Dems had the votes in both houses to override those ridiculous objections (even before the 2 Dems won the run-off elections in Georgia – YAY!!). And the military (ie: all former defense secretaries) had indicated last week they would not get involved, said the time to question the election was passed, and expected a peaceful transition of power to Biden. Big business had also come out in support of the election results and an orderly transition. And I read an article from church and BLM leaders the day before who had decided not to come out in force to confront the protesters out of fear of more violence and it getting out of hand. So I wasn’t too worried about the certification process or the protests. I figured the Trump crazies would spend the day blowing off steam, while the extremists among them like the Proud Boys would pick fights with unlucky passer-byers at night as is their MO. But collectively they wouldn’t be able to overturn what had been a fair and equitable election that the major institutions of the country supported, that is, the will of the people.

I was right that they couldn’t stop it, but they sure did try and what a disaster! B. had the CNN news coverage of the rally and the certification on his Ipad and I just happened to walk into the study to ask him something around 2PM when all hell started breaking loose at the Capital. After that we were glued to our TV sets surfing from channel to channel, as were all our friends as we were all texting back and forth frantically shocked and appalled at what we were seeing. The Capital building was under attack by a rampaging mob of Trump supporters who broke through the barriers around the building, swarmed up the steps on all sides like the insects, broke through doors and windows and rampaged their way to the very doors of the Senate and House chambers. There congressional members were suddenly sheltering in place, lying on floors, cowering behind chairs, praying, crying, told to put on gas masks and finally ushered out the safety by armed guards while other guards tried to keep the crazies at bay until they had been evacuated. The Trump assholes then proceeded to wander all around the chambers smashing things, broke into congressional offices – one ass even decided to sit in Pelosi’s chair and leave her a nasty note -- and generally vandalized the place!

 The outrage on every channel which was covering all this was palpable. Sedition, an attempted coup, insurrection – just about every channel, even Fox News, was using language like that because they were as shocked and appalled as we were. Members of the Senate and House that could be reached by phone were clearly rattled, having been cleared out to an “unknown location” for their safety. And even members of the Republican party were outraged that the president had encouraged all this just to stay in power after an election he so clearly lost. Speaker after speaker on all the networks blamed him regardless of their party affiliation and called for something to be done – not just to stop the protestors but to remove him from office before the inauguration in 14 days for his traitorous acts. And talk of restarting impeachment articles or invoking the 25th so his cabinet could remove him from office before January 20th began to circulate before the evening was over.

 And where the hell were the police? That was what we all kept asking and texting one another. We watched in horror for almost 2 hours before a sizeable police presence began to materialize, and even then they stood mainly on the sidelines, waiting until dusk to gently move the rioters back. Comparisons between the police's egregious treatment of BLM protesters and their gentle treatment of Trump protesters were circulating within an hour on social media. The contrast was stark – heavily militarized police presence over the Summer for BLM but Trump supporters get calmly and kindly escorted down the f**king steps. Just writing about it is making me outraged all over again!

And why hadn’t there been more police and law enforcement to begin with? Everyone – us, texting and FBing with friends, every talking-head on the TV -- was asking that. I mean these were the same idiots who earlier in 2020 had attacked the Wisconsin state house and tried to kidnap the Michigan Governor! So why wouldn’t the police know by now just how dangerous some of these guys could be when whipped into a frenzy by their pig-God leader. And many of his supporters had been pretty clear in all the newspaper accounts I read that they were planning to actively disrupt the proceedings so where was the police presence? It came out during this time that it was Pence, not Trump, who finally called out the National Guard – but I mean WTF again?? Where was Trump during all this? He made a brief video post at one point saying he loved the rioters, it was time to go home, but then he immediately repeated the falsehood that the election was rigged and he was really the winner. Twitter unilaterally decided to suspend his account for 12 hours to prevent him from inciting them any further violence so we have no idea what was going on in the White House or in his senile head during this time. A reporter on CNN with good connections to the White House staff was told “he’s really lost it.”

But then how could Pence even legally take charge and call in the National Guard? Who the hell was in charge at that point? I suspect it was Pence, McConnell and Pelosi (bless her!!) in consultation with one another and other congressional leaders in whatever respective bunkers they’d been herded that made the call to lead without him. Pence had already said the week earlier that he was going to uphold the constitution and the election certification, and of course the first thing Trump and his followers did was label him a traitor and call for his head on a stick. McConnell also turned against the President last week, telling the Senate Republicans to stop all the nonsense and abide by their oath to the Constitution. So I suspect they were finally on the same page with Dems that the orange asshole had FINALLY gone too far (you think?!), was totally out of control and had to be stopped. Given much of the military leadership probably already knew how crazy Trump is, I suspect they were more than happy to listen to Pence for a change. As J said, though, what about the frigging nuclear codes?

But even when the police and national guard did show up, it was infuriating to watch them f**king gently usher those assholes down the Capital steps and away from the building. Most peaceful protests are met with egregious violence -- the George Floyd protests during the Summer were met with a heavy militarized presence, rubber bullets and batons. Yet in this instance, a bunch of crazed white people in Trump hats carrying confederate flags not only were allowed to take over the Capital and lounge like idiots in the Senate President’s chair, but they were gently helped out and pushed back by the police that finally did show up. I’ve since heard that many of the police were on the side of the seditionists, taking selfies with them and so on. I hope they all lose their damn jobs the racist f**ks!

But I do take some satisfaction in knowing that our institutions held in the end – Congressional leaders were doubly committed to getting back into the chambers that night in order to certify the election. By 8PM the building had been secured and the proceedings began, which we watched on CNN, in between watching the commentary outrage on various stations about what had just happened. Many of the Dirty Dozen were mollified now that they had been terrorized by Trump’s goons and thugs themselves. I mean the police even found a pipe-bomb at the RNC headquarters (also the DNC but you’d expect that from these right-wing racist goons), so Republicans are being targeted quite directly by these loons now. That means civil war is breaking out among the Republicans now, between the loons and the sane, which is just fine as far as I am concerned. There was also a lot of pressure that night from their own party leaders to stop f**king around and support the goddamn constitution!

Some still engaged in sedition, however, like Joshua Hawley, Ted Cruz and a bunch of House members who tried to challenge the results from particular states, like Georgia and Pennsylvania. Not even their own states mind you, but ones where they were convinced Trump should have won even though in reality he didn’t. In all those cases, election officials followed the letter of the law, there were no irregularities and court after court after court (most of them with Republican appointed justices) confirmed that no, no, no – there was absolutely no evidence of electoral tampering. But these jerks would disenfranchise vast swarths of American voters just to stay in power. They are the worst kind of human beings as are their rabid followers and supporters. Thankfully they did not have the votes to actually change anything so the certification of Biden/Harris’ election was completed at 3:45AM! YAY!!

 Sunday, 1/10/2021 – The fall-out from last week’s riot has been tremendous, more than I had ever hoped for (as someone who has known what a terrible choice Trump was from the beginning)! Twitter suspended Trump’s account indefinitely, other social media platforms have followed suit – also shutting down sites for things like “Hang Mike Pence” because he is now seen as the ultimate traitor to Trump, their pig-God. Trump’s cabinet has been hemorrhaging members (though I suspect its not because they suddenly saw the light but to avoid having to invoke and participate in the 25th). Dems and some Republicans are looking to introduce Articles of Impeachment this coming week (yes please!). The rioters are being tracked down and arrested because most of them were foolish enough to post everything they were doing on social media (and then tried to take it all down the next day when they realized how much trouble they were in!). The Chief of the Capital Police has already resigned, more to come I’m sure, including some purging of Trump loyalists in the military and throughout different areas of the federal government.

The seditionists in Congress have also become pariahs being punished in various ways– that f**king Nazi Josh Hawley has lost book deals, political mentors and friends and hopefully Ted Cruz is next. Large corporations have put moratoriums on their campaign contributions, sometimes to both parties but most have focused on the seditionists. And while I thought of it as a riot that got stoked up by Trump’s rhetoric and out of hand due to mob mentality (so tended to think the term “coup” was hyperbole), there is increasing evidence that some of the rioters really did intend to take members of congress hostage, complete with zip ties and nooses! Of course, not everyone who participated in the storming of the Capital building intended that, but the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have found evidence of a real plot among some segment of the rioters. Combine that with the slow response of the military, and increasing evidence that Trump supporters within their ranks may have purposefully slowed that response, and calling it an attempt coup may not be hyperbole after all. That is scary as hell!

But it is really gratifying to see these guys on the run after 5 years -- I count the campaign year leading up to Trump’s win as part of their terror campaign for anyone who was tuned in and bothering to notice what a demagogue Trump is. Now much of the media is all like, “oh, how could this happen?” and “how outrageous that they say these things” and I think, where the f**k was your outrage 5 years ago when journalists where being threatened with hanging at all of Trump’s rallies? It’s not like any of these idiots ever tried to hide their sedition and hatred for Democracy, people of color, Libtards and anyone who didn’t think exactly the way they did. They’ve also been talking sedition since day 1 so, while it’s great to finally see them get what they deserve, it also feels pretty late in the game to grow a conscience.

Still it feels good to be so clearly on the right side of history and to have nothing to apologize for in that regard. I keep thinking back to the conversation I had with A down at the pond in 2016, when he asserted that if Hilary won our democracy would be in big trouble. I replied that I thought the opposite was the case, that it was Trump’s election that would threaten our democracy. And then all the FB conversations with Trump supporters after the election who kept saying how great it was going to be, how he was going to fix everything, that we just had to wait and see – soooo frustrating to deal when it was so obviously not true. For us Dems, it was so clear that he was an evil, evil man who didn’t deserve the public trust, was a threat to our democracy and nation and should never have been in office. It’s nice to be so clearly vindicated on that score – he is now being referred to in all quarters as the worst President in American history and I’m pretty sure that is going to stick.

 Sadly he still has lots of clueless supporters and the RNC is still officially backing him. Reading about his supporters in detail often makes me very angry – the stupid, nasty, racists ones in it for the attention, right-wing fame and violence. But sometimes it makes me sad. Many of them are seem like decent people who desperately wanted a social network and found it in these right-wing social media forums. For these people, it was meant to be a fun gathering of like-minded friends, not an attempted coup, but they are now tarnished by the actions of others. I read about a Republican consultant who held a focus group with Trump supporters the day after the riots and he said he was shocked. Normally they are nice to one another but they were now split into three factions – those who think he lost the election and needs to move one, those who think he won the election but needs to move on, and those who think he won and should continue to fight. He said he had never seen such nasty disagreement among Republicans before which does not bode well for party unity. Again its not the dems who did that to them – the Republicans have only themselves to blame for this.

Monday, January 11, 2021 -- In more personal news, K. is closing in on an apartment in NYC, in Morningside Heights near the University. She went down twice last week and we submitted all the paperwork for her applications (including my info as her guarantor). Classes start again for her tomorrow (online) but I expect if all the paperwork goes through then we will be moving her down to NYC in the next two weeks. That’s left me sad and a bit rattled. At least living here I can be sure she is relatively safe from exposure to COVID and safe in general. I can’t keep her safe once she is in the city and her chances of being exposed to the virus will increase.

 Meanwhile the numbers continue to go up – our positivity rate is fluctuating between 6 and 9, New York’s is similar (though NYC may be higher) – so I’m scared to go out and worried about her exposure once she moves. Those are worse than during the summer but much better than many other states – as of today Idaho is 56.6! LA is currently a health crisis mess. And roll-out of the vaccine has been very slow. CT is one of the better states to be on track for administering it, other states are a mess. Hopefully Biden can get this on track once in office since he likes to, you know, actually lead and run the government! But its scary to think of moving her to a place where exposure to more people, including whomever her roommate meets, in inevitable. And what do we do when she wants to come home for a weekend?  Dad thinks he will be able to get the vaccine in February given his age and COPD and I’m hoping and praying he will be able to – it will be a huge relief to me once he is vaccinated.

Meanwhile I’m hoping we’ll get it sometime late Spring – maybe that is too optimistic and it won’t be available to the general public until July or later but I think I will literally go stir crazy being unable to see Dad or Mom or my friends on a regular basis. We did do a “Gathering of the Firepits” the night before New Year’s Eve, everyone brings their portable firepit and wood, we arrange them in a circle along with our camping chairs and our own food and drink, so we can catch up and play stupid games. It worked really well until it started raining about midnight, right in the middle of our second game of Werewolf, and I was knocked out for two days after it due to the cold. I’m very bundled up and warm during the evening but the cold just takes a toll on me and I end up being super fatigued afterwards. I so miss the casualness of dropping by to see someone in the warm over a hot cup of coffee,  or going shopping or out to eat and the movies. And traveling was always what I had to look forward to before Covid. Now ISA Las Vegas is online and I never leave the house because there is no where to go and its so cold outside. No wonder I’m fatigued all the time and sleeping crazy long hours!

FYI-- a friend texted yesterday to say that her husband had a positive case of Covid. No details on how he contracted it, just that his symptoms are mild and they were trying to isolate from one another in their house. Wow, she is someone with underlying conditions so not good at all."

The thing most on my mind is the state of the government...On Wednesday there was an attack on the Capitol and it  has left me really shaken. I am more worried about the political situation right now than the pandemic.  This country is so divided and people are so angry and believing all kinds of lies and propaganda it makes me sick and scared. I am trying to block it out of my mind and avoid being consumed by the news, but I can't help but be anxious about what could happen."
21,journal-entry-6509,"Well, it's been a while since I have made an entry on here. I just realised today that it has nearly been a year since I made my first post- how crazy is that? It's just endless. How has it been a year? How has it nearly been a year since my friends mum passed away from this? I do not think any of us imagine to be in a possible worse position then what we were back in March. It makes me feel angry and sad that we still are not at where we want to be and it frightens me how many (even some of my friends) are not being complaint with rules as they just do not care anymore. We all need to do our bit and not put our spin on the rules. But, I am just absolutely baffled at how badly we have dealt with this here in the UK. Why did we never completely shut down in the first place? Being in lockdown but keeping boarders and flights open is like trying to fill a bucket with water that has a gaping hole in it; it does not work.

 I got sad today as I was chatting to my Nan. She was saying how she misses going shopping and seeing people and it hit me again how the simple pleasure of socialising is really important. It got me thinking as well that, not that my nan is very old but, is this really how they're going to live the years they have left? Locked away? It's horrible to think that basically everyone is isolated in some way and all their plans and ambitions have just been swiped away underneath them. I know that sounds dramatic and of course we are all still getting on with things and people are still studying/working/doing stuff etc... but this is not a way of living that we all expected to have.

 It's weird to think that when this started I was a student finishing my degree and now I work in the NHS during this pandemic. It's like I have seen the pandemic through 2 different eyes: back when I was a student and had nothing to do from March to starting my job gave me time to slow down and appreciate and enjoy the simple things. Nowworking in the NHS (whilst enjoyable) is  very stressful to hear all the grief people have endured over the last year and  to see the inside of healthcare during this pandemic and all the pressures it faces. I'm petrified that it feels like only a matter of time before someone I know is to get it. It almost feels like sometimes that will we ever get out of this?

 Despite this I am really enjoying being a Podiatrist finally. I got my vaccine  just before xmas as well! I  almost felt teary when I received it as it felt like such a huge part of history.  I just  wish people would stop being selfish and follow the rules  and hopefully the vaccine will start to do its job."
22,journal-entry-6492," My sister got her first dose of vaccine - so I am feeling relieved. She's a nurse. Now I get to worry less about her safety. So that is happy.

 On the other hand we had the Capitol breached by far right intruders with 3 of the people next in line to take over as President if something happened to Trump in the building. Scary times we live in. I would never have thought it possible here and the response by peace keepers was horrible. So the pandemic took back seat to that horror even while hospitals in many states are at their max. These are not happy times for the world."
23,journal-entry-6482," 5 January. COVID hits home.

 Sadness: S.'s brother, my brother-in-law, died this morning in Illinois after a rapid decline over the past two weeks. He was in a memory unit for the past two years, where he seemed happy until the last few weeks when he had incidents of aggressive behavior, and this past week began to refuse food and drink. The COVID restrictions had increasingly isolated residents, for a time they were confined to their rooms, entertainment activities were essentially suspended. Quality of life and mental health stimulation was sharply reduced as probably is the case in nursing homes across the country during the pandemic. He was a newspaper man for the Danville Commercial News most of his working life: doing layout and doing the rounds of advertisers, he got to know many of the workers in the town. He was a history buff, music collector (vinyl records, tapes, casettes), occasional thespian, Mason, participated in an American Revolution re-enactment group that traveled the Mid-west, and collector. It was just his flair to show up one day in the post office, his meds in his hands asking for help. The bank staff knew him -- virtues of a small town -- called help and with a day he was resettled in the nursing home, where he seemed relieved and happy. My fantasy is that he was simply saying he was done with his house and living alone. He never asked about the house, his car, or much else, except for some favorite Bing Crosby tunes. In the beginning he would simply say his collection of music had fallen through the floor and was gone. S. has spent the last two years taking care of all that needed doing, visiting when that was possible, along with the help of her niece and husband. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, like all nursing and long-term facilities, this one on the outskirts of a small town, went into quarantine mode, preventing anyone but staff from coming in and out. That made visiting impossible; but a judge still required S. to appear in person for him to grant her becoming his legal guardian -- an anxiety filled flight to Chicago and three-hour drive. Virus free for many months, eventually the virus found its way in and infected staff and residents including J., as noted in the Dec. 26 entry. So a combination of the dementia and COVID. It is strange not being able to go for a funeral or the internment, but S. made all arrangements (again small town, knows the funeral home, run by the son of the man who buried her parents), and they will tape the internment for us. Will have to do something with her niece and her family when the pandemic wanes. S. has been so involved with the care taking day by day,  it’s going to leave a sudden emptiness; the end came quickly. She was still able this morning to talk to him by FaceTime, though unclear what if anything he heard. I last talked to him on Face Time a couple of days ago as he sat in chair with indiscernible if any responsiveness.

 COVID ANXIETY. Our weekly Tuesday call today focused on the new variant of the virus which seems much more infectious, if not more deadly foreshadowing further overwhelming of the medial facilities. It seems detection of the variant itself has been a lucky fluke: only one of the testing kits picked up the ""S"" gene drop; none of the many others do. There seem to be 14-17 mutations. What this means for the effectivity of the current vaccines is unclear. Already in Los Angeles, a friend, an intensivist physician, reports all ICU beds are full, and patients are being handled in other rooms, so far at standard of care. He notes that traditional barriers between departments and even hospitals have broken down, and that at least efficiency and appropriateness of care is increased. Another physician friend who runs a big cancer hospital in Miami says his hospital is now also filling with COVID patients.

 ANXIETY. We go to bed reasonably assured that the Reverend Raphael Gamaliel Warnock has won the Senate race in Georgia ousting the ""piece of work"" Kelly Loeffler (robotic repeater of right-wing nonsense, the richest member of the Senate trying to represent herself as an ordinary farm girl — her family, beneficiary of among largest US agricultural subsidies; she herself a corporate executive and married to the Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange — and spokesperson for ""the people"", read white elites). Jon Ossoff also has a lead over almost equally disingenuous David Perdue (who has spent his single term Senate career on his cell phone sending orders to his broker, and using insider information, has little to his credit, except earlier being a consummate corporate exporter of American jobs to lower wage foreign countries, and having a well-placed cousin, Sonny Perdue, the Trump Commerce Secretary, to get him into politics. Later at night, it is confirmed that Jon Ossoff does in fact win, and McConnell will thankfully no longer be Majority Leader in the Senate and block to any useful legislative action.

 6 January. OUTRAGE & SUPER SPREADER EVENT amidst the counting of the Electoral College votes.

 The world stands agape as white right-wing followers of Trump storm the Capitol and with ease enter the building, smashing windows, enter the floor of the House and Senate and offices of the Speaker and others. Most were not wearing protective masks (which has become a pro-Trump political badge) and there is a good likelihood that they are creating a new super-spreader COVID event. This assault comes in the midst of a joint session of Congress counting the Electoral College certified votes from the states, which had to be suspended for several hours, until it was continued at 8pm until 4am. None of this deterred Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley from objecting to the affidavits from Arizona and Pennsylvania or some hundred Representatives from trying to object to Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada, all not accepted because there was no Senator co-signer.  Cruz invokes the 1877 Compromise as a model for a commission to look into irregularities in voting: for blacks this is further insult and evidence of racism since that Compromise led to the destruction of Reconstruction and the establishment of Jim Crow. T had addressed the crowd in the morning, urged them to march on the capitol, suggesting he might join them (he didn't). When finally there were more and more calls by Republicans for T to call his people off, he made a video merely saying, ""We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You're very special."" Two pipe bombs were found, and there are  four dead, including a Capitol policeman,  injured but able to go home then to the hospital where he died, and a white woman shot by a Capitol Policeman as she attempted to climb through a smashed window (Ashli Babbit, 35, Air Force veteran of fourteen years, who had become a virulent pro-Trump and Qanon supporter, vowing that the Storm was coming to set off a civil war (Storm, has echoes of Nazi Die Sturmer). There is now a video clip of Trump and family celebrating to party music while watching the events at the Capitol,  both Don Jr and wife face the camer, Kimberly Guilfoyle dances, Don smiles broadly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXM6h9elyTY

Jake Angeli, known by followers as the QAnon Shaman showed up in face paint of the flag, fur hat with horns, bare chest and arms tattooed with brick-like patterns, hands in black gloves, and an axe head tatoo on his stomach, posing for pictures with a spear and American flag, and a bullhorn at his waist. In the picture in the NYT, a boy by his side in red Trump hat helds a Trump flag to make it symmetrical with the American flag in Jake's right hand, since his left hand was occupied over his upper chest (heart?). Nick Ochs, founder of Proud Boys Hawaii, and recent GOP nominee for state representative (district 22) which race he lost, was in the crowd [Enrique Tarrio, the 36 year-old Cuban-American leader of the Proud Boys was not among them, having been arrested two days ago.] Richard ""Bigo"" Barnett, 60,  outdid Jake Angeli for visual prominence in a picture snapped by Agence France-Press, by lounging in ""Nancy Pelosi's"" desk chair, putting his left boot up on her desk (not actually her desk), then boasted to the NYT's Matthew Rosenberg that “I wrote her a nasty note [""Nancy, Bigo was here you bitch.”], put my feet up on her desk and scratched my balls.” As Monica Hesse of the WP notes, the picture and others were arresting for the smugness, the gleeful entitlement on individual faces. Indeed I was stunned at the end of the evening when the protesters were finally being gently pushed back, with some small doses of tear gas to clear the steps and lower balcony, how they slowly walked past police lines waving at the police. It is a bit like the white youth in Kenosha (Kyle Rittenhouse) who shot two people to death and walked by a police car with his rifle saying I just shot somebody, and they waved back at him. (He was arrested two days later due to the uproar.). Black news commentators are not shy in pointing out that had this been a black crowd, the handling of the crowd would have been very different.

Former members of the Capitol police express astonishment that  aid offered ahead of time by the FBI, DoD (for the National Guard), and Maryland and Virginia police had been declined by the Capitol police, since such back up is normal procedure for big demonstrations, and not even a perimeter had been set up. The Chief of the Capitol police has resigned, but this smells like the infiltration of police forces across the country by white supremacists.

How could the Capitol have been so unprotected? More intense calls now for invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. It is reported that when D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser asked for help from the National Guard -- because DC is not a state the request has to go up through DoD to the President -- T refused (""resisted"") is the word the press used, but it was Mike Pence who signed off, and it was reported that it was Mike Pence who was in communication with DoD through-out the day and siege, which optimists interpreted as a kind of invocation of the 25th A.; but on 7 January morning Pence refused to come to the phone when Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were on line (put on hold for 25 minutes) to urge him to invoke the 25th Amendment, and let it be known he was opposed to doing that. Members of the judiciary committee in the House are drawing up articles of impeachment. Finally only today, Jan 7, have some four thousand plus political appointees been asked for their routine resignations in advance of a new administration. Two cabinet members have also resigned, probably to avoid any possibility of being asked to help invoke the 25th Amendment to declare Trump unfit and remove him: Elain Chow, the Commerce Secretary and wife of Mitch McConnell; and Betsy DeVois, Education Secretary and sister of mercenary, former SEAL, Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater (renamed Xe and now Academi) saying she was upset by the violence. (The British Empire is now a clothing store; Academi is a mercenary force of military veterans for hire.)"
24,journal-entry-6499,"I think I am settling in to this new normal. We had a surprisingly wonderful time using Zoom to chat and play games remotely with friends and family we usually gather with on New Year’s Day. I feel like I’m really hitting my stride working from home and getting the hang of how to continue to focus on building and maintaining relationships and networks nearly as well as I did in person in the office. 

 Frankly, being isolated at home physically has helped me to mentally and emotionally escape a bit into a bubble too—despite previously commuting to downtown Washington DC nearly every day (the last time I stopped in for computer equipment the windows were boarded up and the street in front was a police staging area) I’ve been lucky to have plenty of remote work and home improvement activities to keep me from completely freaking out over insurrection at our capital and endlessly wondering if that was a disgusting isolated event or the beginning of a terrifying and tragic new chapter for our country... but hey who has time to worry about democracy when the cabinet organizers have arrived and there are dishes to endlessly move from shelf to shelf and back again?"
25,journal-entry-6493," I have friends and/or family in LA and SF and it has been hard this year - first the fires and then the pandemic. Two of my old friends in LA that I used to work with when I lived there got COVID but both recovered thank goodness. One of them lost her father to the disease and that was very sad. My stepmom (90 years young) is in IL living with her son and his wife - they are fine. Also have a friend in Tucson - she's fine. My son and his family live in VT and they are OK - quite rural where they live. His father, my ex, lives in NM in rural area and is ok. My sister and her husband are in ME and she got her first dose of the vaccine this week. She's a nurse at a longterm care facility. Stepson and partner in OR  are OK and stepdaughter is now in CT but splits time between CT and NY - she may need to return to OK for the coming semester unless it's still remote classes. Also have good friends in PA - they are OK and in France, Ecuador, and Britain - they all seem ok so far. I think about the toll all the quarantining is taking on our mental health and social selves.

 I sometimes wonder how I will interact with others in person again after this is all over. It's been so long.

 What I miss most is being able to see my grand girls and their parents and giving them hugs and doing stuff with them...  hoping for summer but it's not a sure thing yet. This is the longest I've gone without seeing them in person - we do virtual but it's not the same thing. Last time in person was in August.

Re grad students (our other ""children"") - we have one in China - he's pretty much stuck there, but the upside is that his Chinese is improving and he got a dog for company.  Another was going to go to India for her dissertation research, but Fulbright shut that down for now - maybe in the summer 2021 - she's doing what she can online. This whole thing is taking a year from all those who have MA or PhD plans for research abroad - UConn has extended times to graduate for them thank goodness.

So, I really miss the ability to see my family and friends in person."
1,journal-entry-6510,"I feel as though it's very hard to foresee or plan for things as we are all still in that mindset of 'lets just wait for it to be over,' but then what if it never blows over? It's difficult to stay motivated and it's very frustrating not being able to just do things. However, i feel as well that my motivation has been focused now on more close to home things like I am keeping up with exercise at home and doing extra learning for work. I have picked up a few more hobbies as well. It's just mad that it has been this long. I miss being able to do things to see people- I have not seen one of my closest friends in a year."

I have looked to different sources of guidance and support for my emotions during this pandemic. Some have been helpful, and some not so much.

 My local church changed pastors shortly before this pandemic started.  The new pastor is a young man with ties to other places and friends. He participates in activities that take him well beyond the local town. He is on vacation a lot for someone that is supposed to be praying for the sick and taking care to avoid unnecessary travel. I haven’t really had much of chance to get to know him better, and his sermons on the internet are stiff and shallow. Going to church is an expression of my religious faith, but he contributes more to the stress.

I also look to different internet sources for inspiration. Facebook has been a way to connect with friends and fellow church members that I do get inspiration from. We exchange brief messages and memes of hope and look for life to return to normal. I also use the internet to connect to different religious evangelists that are more skilled with the internet. Their messages seem more personal and heartfelt."
3,journal-entry-6463," I'm on the list to get the vaccine. I found out yesterday that CMU is putting its EMTs on the list of their healthcare workers. We could be receiving our first doses a month from now. It's a lot to think about.  I assumed I'd be getting the vaccine as a healthy young adult (at the very end of the priority list). So I haven't been paying the closest attention to the rollout of the vaccine distribution program. Nobody really knows how long it's going to take to get to the general population, but it'll definitely be months at the very least. But now I might be looking at weeks instead of months or even closer to a year like most of my friends.

 I don't think my life will change that much after I get the vaccine. COVID safety measures will be in place for months if not indefinitely, and I plan to keep wearing a mask and limiting my exposure to others as much as possible. But it's kind of strange to think that most of my friends won't be getting their vaccines until months after me. I haven't told any of them. Would that seem like bragging? I don't know the etiquette for this. COVID has infiltrated so much of my social life that I sometimes don't know what to talk about other than the pandemic and Zoom and social distancing and the vaccine.

 But it is a relief, to know that I'll be getting the vaccine soon. I'm careful. I wash my hands and wear a mask and follow social distancing measures. But there's still a fear. We ordered food from Tarim a few weeks ago, and the rice that is usually very flavorful tasted bland to me. That was scary.Then there was the period I had a coughing fit every night (I think my room was dusty). That worried me, too. Near the end of the semester, my temperature started trending from the 97-98 range to the 99s for a few days, and I wondered if I could be starting to get a fever. It wasn't always like this. I didn't think about these things so much before the pandemic. Even with the vaccine offering an additional level of protection, I think there will always be some anxiety. We all want to think that we're that one-in-a-million, whether it's lottery tickets or COVID-19. I think that sometimes I just need to remind myself that I'm not special. What's probably going to happen is the statistically most likely option, which is that I get both doses of the vaccine, maybe a little bit of soreness or fever, then I develop antibodies and never get COVID. But I worry anyway.

And then there's the part of me that feels like I could be taking a vaccine away from someone who needs it more. If I don't get my vaccines now, and instead wait in line until my turn as a healthy adult comes up (which is almost certainly spring or later), maybe another essential worker or a nursing home resident, or a prison inmate will live. Someone who isn't able to take as many social distancing measures as I am, and who is going to get exposed to the virus in the next few months. I know I can't measure my life in terms of the butterfly effect; otherwise, I could never do anything. I can't guarantee what will happen if I do or don't take the vaccine, and taking it is the best thing I can do to keep myself and the people around me safe."
4,journal-entry-6451,"Since I have a good resistance against viruses and disease, I wasn't affected by the outbreak on a physical health basis. However, I got impacted in many other ways, such as mentally, financially, emotionally, and in my daily activities. For example, I lost access to many of the activities that I used to do before the pandemic, such as going to the gym, eating breakfast at the dining, hanging out with friends, going to the library, visiting museums, and other sorts of entertainment, which lead to a lot of emptiness to my life. Also, I used to be an uber driver, but because of the crisis, most people are now quarantined at home, which caused me to lose my job and be stuck financially. Being at home for almost a year has directly affected my mental wellness and caused me anxiety, and the fact that there is an outbreak makes me uncertain about the future, and, can't stop worrying about it."
5,journal-entry-6453," The one thing about the COVID-19 restrictions that I am really angry about is not seeing my friends or hugging them. (Yes it's true. I'm a hugger.)

Several things have happened last week to make me take notice of the world around me. They have happened at the personal, local and national level.

 On the personal front, I still work in a restaurant. The managers are still cautious with respect to COVID, taking our temperature everyday with an infrared thermometer. They record it all on a chart, and keep the chart filed away for some sort of review. But what makes me take notice is that a coworker was sent home for high fever two weeks ago, and now she is back. She still coughs, talks about aches, and takes medication. She says she has the flu, not COVID, but I am nervous. I keep thinking, “What if it had been COVID?” Not a comfortable idea. I have to trust both my coworkers and the social/medical systems that are in place to give me honest information.

 On the local level, the new year has brought changes to the reporting systems for the outbreak. The new county judge was sworn in early to fill a vacancy left when the old judge resigned to take a new job outside of the county. Changes are natural, and the new judge and the county emergency management coordinator have decided that they will no longer post the daily COVID report on Facebook. But I took notice when they announced that COVID figures will now be on the county website. However, the county website does not come up easily on a search engine, and no figures are posted. I guess that I will have to keep checking back on the website, or look for more information elsewhere. Some information is on Apple News and on The Weather Channel, but it does not have the community breakdown that the old report did. I have to trust much more impersonal sources on the internet for accurate information.

 On the national level, I certainly noticed the attacks on the US Capitol. I am appalled. No doubt the social conditions created by the lockdowns and constraint imposed to halt the spread of COVID contributed to the unrest. Some see lockdowns as proof that they cannot trust the government to safeguard their civil rights in difficult times. People without outlets for expression have turned to rumors and theories. Troublemakers have found a way to tap this energy for their own purposes. And we all still have to trust that the future will be better."
7,journal-entry-6474," People in Florida, apparently, can get the vaccine at age 65 instead of age 75. People in Florida with no pre-existing condition are signing up for the vaccine and will probably get it before me, a 74 year old woman with a history of cancer.

This is not fair."
8,journal-entry-6484," The pandemic was the last thing on my mind this week--especially after Wednesday.

Partly personal: I had a job come in (freelance writer) so was having a normal self-isolation with nose to the computer. Then the horrible events in DC were a shock, driving other thoughts and fears out of mind.

One small effect: I made a 4 hour round trip drive to Louisville--and because of covid fears made no stops for water, lunch, bathroom breaks. So...no fun on the road trip."
9,journal-entry-6461," After the attempted coup at the Capitol yesterday, I feel very anxious and unsettled. It is difficult to work or to concentrate, despite looming deadlines. Watching the interruption of the peaceful transfer of power, a threat to our democracy, was and is distressing. Seeing the confederate flag in the Capitol was especially heart-wrenching.

 I am also deeply concerned for the after-effects of this mass gathering for the pandemic. I've seen speculation that this is going to be a spreading event similar to the Sturgis motorcycle rally. While I'm not sure how the attendance numbers line up, the process seems similar.

 Another distressing issue as of late is seeing the hospitals in LA filled past capacity and other hospitals in the US rushing to catch up. How long until we are at the point where we should not expect medical care after an accident? Until we should not expect care for those with heart conditions? With diabetes and comorbidities?"
10,journal-entry-6476," I feel my life is going well right now in spite of the pandemic. am 64 years old. My main health problems are obesity, sinusitis/allergies, and hypothyroidism which do not affect my lifestyle. I have a full-time job in a clean and safe environment working with people I like. I live in a rural community where I feel safe and secure. I have a home with all the comforts I need, plenty of food, clean water, and a car that runs well. I have good health insurance and enough money to pay the bills. My husband is in relatively good health and we have pets who are great companions.

I miss walking through my old neighborhood, running into a friend and having coffee.

 I think the overarching loss is the sense of safety I had in the world. Now, every interaction is fraught with danger and mistrust. When I run necessary errands ( drug store, post office, grocery store) I am suspicious of everyone I interact with. I am not sure that will ever go away completely."
13,journal-entry-6442," I started the week feeling very anxious and depressed, really, the worst of the whole pandemic.  I was upset about the slow rollout of the vaccines, the increasing case numbers, the Georgia elections and the certification vote today in congress to declare Biden the next president. I was feeling really homebound and worried and depressed about the future.  But I decided to wait until Wednesday to write because I figured whatever I wrote Tuesday when I got my link would be outdated by Wednesday night. I certainly didn't predict how crazy the last 12 hours would be!

 It's now the evening of January 6th, a most remarkable day in US history. I think it will take us days to really process this, how easy it was for these people to storm the Capitol. How so many Republicans had to be personally threatened to finally say enough to Trump. Their hypocrisy is disgusting, that they could not stand up to him before they saw the impact of his rhetoric in person, that they are all so self-serving. All of those congress people and senators who were going to vote to not certify the election should be ashamed of themselves for perpetuating these lies.

 I live 6 miles from the US Capitol  and have been down there many times over the last four years (pre-pandemic) for protests and demonstrations. So many questions are unanswered tonight. but especially this one; how were the US Capitol Police not prepared for the size and aggression of this mob? Or did they just not really care? Did they support the Trump supporters? The double standard for white Trump protesters, vs. BLM and climate change protests is remarkable.

Meanwhile, we got the best gift ever this afternoon: two democratic senators from Georgia and the US Senate!!!. I feel like the nation owes the people of Georgia a great debt--ADIOS to Mitch McConnell as majority leader, and hopefully now we'll have some serious legislative reform to turn ""Norms"" into rules or laws so that another crazy person like Trump can't bend the law to his will. Who would have ever guessed that the southern segregationist state of Georgia would turn out to save U.S. Democracy? (Note to self: next vacation go spend money in Georgia NOT Florida!)

In other good news, my daughter, who is a nursing student  and going to do her final practicum this spring, got a call today that she is eligible for the vaccine. I'm so happy for her and every other medical worker that they are first in line, and that the roll-out, although slow, is more or less going okay here in my state. My husband, who works in a public school, will also be eligible soon. When people you know are getting the vaccine, it makes the end of all of this much more concrete.

 I've been binge watching a show about the US government getting blown up in the Capitol. Very weird to watch a government falling apart on TV, and then in real life too. Hopefully both will have a better ending than beginning."

15,journal-entry-6402," I lost a lot of time on my dissertation this year, and it absolutely set me back in my progress. It terrifies me. I think I can still finish ""on time,"" (i.e., before too much time has passed for me to finish). I know that if I were in danger of not finishing in that window, my advisor would warn me, and I'm reasonably confident that if I were in danger of not finishing on time, the university would take the pandemic into consideration, but it still terrifies me. I just couldn't bring myself to write during the pandemic because it felt so monumental and I really didn't know how long it was going to go on. I managed to complete one chapter draft during the pandemic; I really should have completed two. I was barely still managing to meet my obligations with my remote job.

 And at one point, the power company was doing some work and caused such an enormous power surge that it fried my desktop's hard drive, even plugged into a surge protector (several other less important appliances never worked again after that, too). Nothing from the power company, no acknowledgement of what happened, let alone an apology or some sort of compensation. So, while I couldn't set foot on campus to use a real computer due to the pandemic, I was trying to do my job and write my dissertation on the crappiest, tiniest old laptop that I'd been meaning to discard. I was just extremely lucky that none of my writing or archival research was only saved to that computer.

I was supposed to teach a summer course last semester, which was cancelled. I was supposed to present my research at a conference, which was postponed and then cancelled.

 I'm an Irish dancer, a hobby I keep up because I enjoy it and it keeps me in shape. We abruptly lost St. Patrick's Day 2020. We had one performance, on March 8th, and everything after that was cancelled. I never in a million years would have guessed that we wouldn't have St. Patrick's Day 2021, either.

 It feels horrible to be upset about any of this when I have not lost my income and no one I am close to has been sick. And unlike most PhD students, I wasn't teaching or taking courses, so I never once had to deal with Zoom classes (except dance classes). I am lonely being single and living alone, but at least I am not responsible for a child's needs (especially educational) during this pandemic.

 I'm simultaneously totally broken from being all alone for nine months and feel like the biggest piece of shit for not having anything really bad happen to me or anyone I love."
16,journal-entry-6435," I'm really not doing much for fun right now, except for going on the internet and maybe playing music. I went to visit a friend for her birthday the other day which was nice, but I had an anxiety attack afterwards  which I think was a sign. Before the pandemic, I would go out at least one a week to see friends, or just hang out with people. It was always really nice, and I never though much about it until the pandemic, when I didn't do it anymore.

After my anxiety attack this week, where I was really just sad about not being able to talk to people and feeling lonely, I think I need to consciously find ways to have fun, laugh and most importantly, spend time with my friends. These past few months I've been going out to see one of my best friends at her apartment more, and every time I go I have a great time, even if all we're doing is eating dinner, watching a movie, or going on a walk.

 I realize now just how much in-person human connection is vital, especially with those you're closest to who truly understand you."
17,journal-entry-6445," iI definitely get support from music. I've paid to watch/listen to several concerts and a play. Heh, musicians and actors need to make a living.

 Some houses of worship are doing a good job of continuing to meet the needs of their congregants. Others have done so less well. Some synagogues drop off treats for their congregants for the Sabbath. Ours don't. I have enjoyed a lot of walks with friends and these have often given me solace. I went for a walk in a town park with a friend (with masks on). We climbed and slid on the playground. The exercise felt good. I kind of doubt that we would have found the time to do that in the absence of COVID.

I have asked both a rabbi and Jewish Family Service if they could create discussion groups for people feeling lonely (but not specifically having a mental illness) but they have not done so."

Always reign in those emotions 

When the folks don’t get it 

When your pain is painted over 

When the memories seem like far off dreams

Nightmares of violence that you know are real 

But always conceal because no one wants to know 

No one wants to know the real truth 

Of what actually happens 

After the shots are fired

After the beatings are done

After the violence walks away 

After the government reaps rules 

Regulating rulers reaching rising 

Up even higher at the expense of the poor

I just wish that for once someone can just be there

To believe that shadows have feelings too 

Despite their dark nature 

Always by your side and yet never given 

A chance to confide that so many things have 

Happened I don’t even know what’s real anymore 

The memory’s dream or the nightmare 

Containing partial truths of a half twisted lie 

By societies design I always have to bite my tongue

And I bite it hard to be able to not push people away 

With these raw uncooked emotions

How they have not been steamed or fried yet 

But people wait for those moments when the water

Manipulates the environment and substance of you 

Yourself to really see what you have to say

I just want to keep everything at bay 

Simmering down but alas I always feel that the 

Flame runs so hot we get burnt too fast 

Making it our last chance to reach folks instead 

Of taking time to turn off the burner, lower the heat 

And breathe in knowing that the heat can’t always be hot

We need that time to cool down and accept some cold

Until we are ready again 

But alas here we are all burnt up inside again 

Wanting to just figure it out and start over 

Knowing that there’s always so much more of everything;

I always have to keep reminding myself to not fan my own 

Flames firing first, fear fiercely flying for falling aforementioned 

Is inevitable 

Sometimes the best thing to do is place it on the back burner 

For later when the heat dies down 

And the moisture leaves the air 

Creating the calm stillness to start a fresh project

It’s okay to not be okay

And understand how life is hard 

But you don’t have to be as hard as the 

Surroundings that mold you. "
19,journal-entry-6434,"Okay, so for this week's journal entry I was going to write about how the pandemic forced me to become closer to my family, or how I finally released the music I worked on during the pandemic, but... What. The heck. Is happening?!?!?

 WHY are the Trumpies STORMING THE CAPITOL?! This is absolutely CRAZY. There have to be hundreds of them. I still can't believe they actually are currently on the senate floor!! This is still happening as I write this entry, and the payor of DC has just issued a stay at home order or something as a result. This is crazy!!! I knew that the Trump supporters and the proud boys would be protesting in the capitol today, but storming the capitol and occupying the senate? What the actual fuck.

 From the footage I saw, it seemed like once they actually got to the senate floor they were just milling around,  looking at the floor while holding their signs and not really doing anything, with the exception of going through some of the senators' desks. I was honestly surprised that no one stood in the center of the room or made a speech or anything, and it honestly seemed like they didn't expect to actually get to the senate floor, like they didn't really have a plan once they got there.

I was talking with my brother about how the president would respond, since he probably didn't expect them to actually go inside the capitol building. After we were wondering about what he would say, a pre-recorded message from Trump played on the TV, and it was really weird. He started off by STILL saying that the election was a 'steal' and that he won, which is exactly the opposite of what he should have said. The people are in the capitol for that exact reason, so that would rile them up even more. He continued to say that the people should go home, and weirdly enough, he said ""I love you,"" which struck me as really odd. Why would he say that? It just seemed weird and didn't sit right with me, especially for a pre-recorded message. I can't believe this is what our country has come to, and I'm glad that President-Elect Biden had some reassuring words to say to the American people about the situation. The fact that he responded to the American public before Trump and publicly denounced the protestors as insurrectionists while reassuring the American people speaks volumes."
20,journal-entry-6382,One thing that is making me sad is people dying. One thing that’s making me angry is people not wearing masks. 
21,journal-entry-6379," Today my total attention to the news is off the pandemic and on the fact that Georgia has elected the first black senator. That is quite a monumental event in our history. My jubilation is Covid related in that it will no doubt, make it easier for the new president, Biden, to get legislation passed to fund the things that need doing to get us over the pandemic both medically and financially. Actually there were two Democrats from Georgia elected as senators to give the democrats the majority in the senate. The number of senators from each party is even, but the Vice President, Harris, a democrat, holds the winning vote in the case of a tie. Mitch McDonnell, the republican majority leader will have to step down. Hopefully this will finally bring more Republicans away from the Trump party and create a more democratic republican group that has concerns only on doing what is best for the country and upholding the law as we have seen it in the Obama years. Perhaps after the meeting of the electoral college today “Trumpism” will finally be put to rest forever. That is my wishful thinking but realistically it is not likely that Trump will disappear."
22,journal-entry-6400," It's been very interesting to compare ""my"" three political leaders. I am an American living in Scotland, so I have been watching the US president, the UK prime minister, and Scotland's First Minister, as the three of them navigate - or not - the challenges of lockdown, health, the economy, travel, school.

The US and the UK have both been among the nations hit hardest by the pandemic. Scotland, too, has been hit hard. What I've really noticed is that even though the infection and death rates are comparably bad, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister, has managed to inspire confidence and trust. It seems to come down to her public approach: she briefs the nation every day, she expresses compassion for the suffering, she admits to her shortcomings, and she encourages solidarity. It is a stark contrast to the confused and sometimes patently untrue propaganda presented by Donald Trump and Boris Johnson.

 Sturgeon's success at mitigating the effects of the pandemic hasn't really been any better than her counterparts. But her political finesse has ensured that she has impressed not only her own people, but those of nations around the world.

It seems to me to be a lesson in how to present yourself as a politician."
23,journal-entry-6401," I have felt very lonely and insecure since returning home to living alone in my one-bedroom apartment after spending Thanksgiving through New Year's with family. I try to dive head-first into my work (working remotely for an archival project and my dissertation), and that does help. I've been scheduling Zoom hangouts with friends on most days. I have a very close friend in my PhD program who has been living with family for six months and is about to go back to living alone. I worry for her, but at the same time, it helps make me feel less alone that she's in the same situation.

Honestly, the first six months of all of this, working from home, never leaving my apartment, never seeing anyone, really wasn't that bad. But I hit my limit, sometime around August or September. I became incredibly depressed. I just can't do this forever. Even though I'm not going to take risks, I honestly understand and empathize with the people who have lost it and can't take the isolation anymore.

I am receiving an at-home test from my workplace so I can go back to working in the office a couple days a week, everyone staggered so we're only with one or two other people at a time. I am looking forward to spending time on site, but at the same time, it's incredibly lonely there with the staggered schedule."
24,journal-entry-6326," My support comes from my coworkers, my family, and my temple family. Of course, my coworkers are dealing with the same issues that I am, work-related. We've always been able to share and rely on each other for support. My family, too, is very supportive. My husband is a retired nurse, so he absolutely understands. My temple family, the congregation, has been my cheerleaders. They seem to know exactly when I need to hear those words of encouragement. Each time we meet for virtual Shabbat services or weekly Shabbat blessings, they ask me how things are at the hospital and how I am. They have literally clapped and cheered for me. I don't feel that I deserve it, but they disagree. Regardless, they make me feel like a hero."
25,journal-entry-6335,"Yes and no - in some ways I've had to change my exercise routine, but in other ways it hasn't changed at all. I've always exercised outside, with some exercise indoors too. We have a bike set-up on a trainer at home that I use inside and then I like to run and hike outdoors. When I spin on the bike indoors hasn't really been impacted by the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, I wouldn't give a second thought to when I would go for a run, and for hiking I would often go with friends or other hiking groups for day hikes close by. For my runs, I would usually go early in the morning before getting ready for work, etc. and it wouldn't matter where I ran. Once the pandemic started, my husband was worried about me running in the dark so early in the morning, so I frequently wait until sunrise to go for a run, or try to squeeze it in during my lunch break (especially, if I don't have meetings in the afternoon where I need to shower and stuff right away). But, I also have to think about the routes I take or when I go for my runs or any hikes now. For popular trails, my general rule of thumb is that it's still not too many people on the trails before 10a.m. if I want to get in my run or hike by then. Or, for popular trails I can go pretty much any time if the weather is crappy (really cold, rainy, etc.). For my hikes I've been doing a lot of solo hiking, with some distanced hiking with a couple friends, but trying to keep distance while hiking with friends can be difficult sometimes. Just writing all of this out makes me tired thinking about all of the logistics and things I think about before I step out the door to exercise.

 One thing I will say about the pandemic, it has truly unveiled to me the importance of exercise during this prolonged stressful period. I really don't think I would be able to keep my sanity if I didn't have my time out of the house to burn off some energy, frustration, or just plain zone out. While I don't always look forward to going out for a run or hopping on the bike. I'm always glad I did it afterwards (that hasn't changed with the pandemic)."
1,journal-entry-6341," We are moving so i am excited to be in a new home, my dad and his wife came down to visit and was SO hard not to hug him. They are heading to florida for 4 mo. and i worry that they will get sick, that this last time i saw them i didn't just give them a hug and take the chance, and i worry that they will not be careful enough once away and we'll have no way to help them"
2,journal-entry-6332," I have a 14 year old son. He has always been a joyful, smart, active kid. He would tell you he didn't really like school in the past but the transition to ""zoom school"" has been hard. He has gone for months at a time never seeing someone his own age except through a screen. He plays less and scrolls through his phone more. He's an athlete, whose sports were all cancelled. My older son eventually left college to come home as well. I'll talk about him later.

In the beginning of Covid getting bad here I insisted that I would supplement their relatively poor online school experience by teaching them one ""essential life skill"" a couple of evenings a week if I wasn't working. They thought I was being ""extra"" about school. I was actually worrying I might get sick and die and thinking of all the things I hadn't taught them. I'm a single parent and a health care worker. What would happen if I fell ill? I taught them how to sew a button on a shirt, how to cook a few simple healthy meals for themselves,

how to find the 23d psalm in the Bible, how to shuffle a deck of cards like a pro, how to start seeds indoors, how to get a hard workout done in the basement with only a few weights and a yoga mat. One night I taught them how to open a wine bottle - but that was for me.

 My 14 year old became quieter, laughed less. Looked distracted and bored in zoom school. Slept poorly and climbed into my bed one night because he had had a bad dream that his grandparents had died and he  started wondering what would happen to him if I died.

 I promised him I wouldn't die, that I was being super careful, that I had enough masks and gloves and gowns to keep me safe. I knew I wasn't being entirely truthful, but it made him feel better and really,  that's part of my job as his mom- to keep him believing in some type of normal."
3,journal-entry-6317," I'm pretty active on Facebook, my kids would say too active.When I see good articles about why we should be careful to avoid COVID I post them. However I post them in a way that excludes my conservative friends, to avoid getting in arguments with them. Several of them thing COVID is not nearly as bad as it is portrayed in the mainstream media. I don't agree. My aunt (with whom I wasn't close), my favorite English teacher, a friend from high school's mother and my sister-in-laws uncle all died from COVID.

Back to a general post, we have had two friends whose sister died in a country across the Atlantic but they were unable to attend the funeral due to COVID."
4,journal-entry-6340," I've been working as a pediatric specialist for nearly 30 years. One of the things that always brought me the most joy was interacting with patients and families in meaningful communication and sometimes even in play. I loved reassuring small children and their families that as sick as they might be, they would be cherished as the delightful, vibrant, individual children that they had always been, despite and through the illness or injury that brought them to my care. Taking a break from the constant barrage of need and noise and nuance of the world of critical care by talking to a family or playing with a child not only sustained me, but helped me understand the patients and the families better, making me a better doctor. Now- with my mask, goggles or face shield, isolation gowns, gloves etc, I am unable to do this. I cannot watch as closely for non verbal cues from the parents who are similarly masked and shielded, the kids find us all slightly terrifying, no matter how smiley or compassionate we try to make our eyes and our voices muffled through the masks. The soothing touch of skin on skin for a fretful infant is not an option. The toddlers recoil from our billowing masked and shielded selves. the parents are even more exhausted in their own battles with isolation, financial stressors and now- a critically ill child. I wanted to put up a contrasting picture taken precovid of a rare break to play with a child, but cannot upload two. It is a striking contrast.

 I miss the doctor I was once able to be."
5,journal-entry-6343,"Everyday I half heartedly listen to the news and read the lates test COVID-19 statistics and think about how my life and the world has changed since the virus. I also wonder when or if it will ever go back to the way it was or if that is even possible?

 The vaccine was a bright Hope whose light quickly faded out as we have had countless problems with shipment distribution and health care people available to administer it.

 I worry that they healthcare workers will burn out and no one will replace them.

The new more contagious virus is like a speeding train to our breaking point as a nation.

 Once I get the vaccine I can go back to work to be worked to death because so many library staff have retired, quit or gone to different branches that we are majorly short staffed.

 I remind myself to be grateful that I have a job, but it’s difficult to remain hopeful and happy right now."
6,journal-entry-6323," With the news of some of my friends receiving the first vaccine I felt really hopeful. I bought clothes that I could eventually wear back to work and thought about all of the wonderful things that 2021 could bring. I am hoping that we will be vaccinated by the fall and may daughter can start middle school by walking in the door with her friends. But of course, with the excitement of the holiday (even though we didn't really do anything!) and everything leading up to it, I felt busy and hopeful. Now, I know there is darkness that is going to run its course and we have to hope we can safely get through the next few months +.  I am still going to hold on to my hope, but I feel that we are in the one foot in front of the other mode again. It's daunting."
7,journal-entry-6336,"I am about to begin teaching another course on Zoom, and the prospect of teaching in the near future, as well as mentoring and other aspects of my professional life, all occurring via Zoom, is daunting. Although I am very lucky, so grateful to have the networks and support, personal and professional, that I have, I am quite lonely and miss having the interstitial interactions that make up so much of social life, as well as the planned and more structured in-person social interactions associated with activities like teaching.

 I find my self missing the qualities of social interactions, the glimpses of other people and their worlds that can be difficult to perceive online. And just a sense of physical closeness.

 And I'm an introvert by nature!

I've also been saddened by the recent death of yet another elderly person in my social world. So far this year I have had 2 friends and my sister-in-law lose a parent, and yesterday my father's aunt passed away as well. My sister-in-law's mother died of COVID-related complications. My neighbor's husband also died of COVID. That is a total of 5 elderly people in my social/familial circles who have died since July 2020. Two of these died of COVID-related complications. They were all impacted by COVID isolation and the challenges of not being able to see family during the pandemic prior to and during their illnesses.

These are some of the aspects of COVID that are pressing on me this week, and I am surprised by how much I appreciate being able to write down some of these thoughts and share them!"
8,journal-entry-6325," I have deliberately avoided journaling for the past few weeks. I just didn't want to think about what is happening. The surge is here. Our COVID ICU is full and some patients are in the overflow area now. The COVID floor, which only had part of it blocked off for COVID patients, has now been fully opened. I see the daily positive numbers for our county increase every day. We're back to that crazy, busy, hectic pace that leaves me exhausted and in a daze. The fact the people are still not wearing masks and keeping a safe distance boggles my mind. We are going on a year of dealing with this. What will it take for everyone to take it seriously?"
9,journal-entry-6309,"The hope of a vaccine and the realization that it will take a long time to get it. 

The sadness of so many cases and deaths.

The losses so many people have had.

The overwhelming sadness that our government won't help people who are in need. 

The hope that things will return to normal."
10,journal-entry-6322," I don't know where the economic effects of the pandemic will lead us, and I try to live day by day. My immediate family is not too badly affected - many of those I love are retired, so they are all right; most of my cousins have been able to keep their jobs. My sister, who is at the low end of the economic spectrum, has been able to get retail work.

 The person I worry about the most is my daughter, who is two years out of a film degree. The pandemic has prevented her from making the projects she organized for this year, and for which she still has funding. The pandemic has prevented her from carrying out work she was hired for this year and for which she tentatively is still on board to do next year. In the meantime she's been doing video work, so her skills are definitely in use, but she feels that this is an entire year out of her life in which she ought to have been getting a foot up in the industry, and in which absolutely nothing has happened. And I think she lives day to day as well, because it's not obvious how the entertainment industry will recover - or if there will be any difference for her in 2021.

This entry doesn't really address the economy. I think that the entertainment industry, AND the global economy, in general, will recover: things will be DIFFERENT. Perhaps we will become less of a consumer society. Tourism will change. I could have written an entire entry on the aviation industry, rather than entertainment: airlines folding, pilots and aviation workers furloughed with little hope for future work; like entertainment, aviation will be DIFFERENT. But I feel that developments within the next few years will assist recovery. We are all waiting for a chance to work again and we are willing to work."
11,journal-entry-6316," Something very difficult happened to us nine days ago. My family wanted to circle around us and hug us. The short answer would be that they weren't able to do this because of COVID. Instead we had a family Zoom call on a Saturday night. My sister and daughter and nephew and their spouses and brother and son were all there! It felt like a virtual hug.

My sister-in-law couldn't make it so a couple of days later she and my brother called and did some nice sharing.

What is interesting about this event was that it wouldn't have been very different in the absence of COVID except that these close relatives could offer to come visit to support us if we needed the support. They are in different places, CA, DC, OH, VT, and it's not likely that they would have dropped everything to come and support us. But they would have been able to offer.

It is even possible that if COVID had never happened my sister wouldn't have thought of having an organized family gathering via Zoom, though it would have been the best option anyway.

 We traveled to DC to see our daughter, son-in-law and grandson. We got COVID tests before we went and got tests when we were there as CT requires in order to return without quarantining. Our daughter also wanted us to get tested to be sure her baby wouldn't be bringing COVID back to daycare the next week.

 While we were there they got a night away and we watched the baby. I drove her to where they were staying. If it weren't for COVID they would have taken the Metro. We never drove to see them before COVID. WE always flew, except once when we took the train, with my in-laws for our grandson's bris.

They are very careful about COVID and don't shop on weekends or holidays. Our daughter makes challah bread every other week. She made it last week and this week because we were visiting and Friday was a holiday they didn't go shopping so they had no challah bread, which was too bad.

 We went to see our son-in-law's mother, who is disabled. Because of COVID we walked around outside with her for 45 minutes. THe park was the highest place in DC and pretty windy, so it was quite cold."
12,journal-entry-6314," I have thoroughly enjoyed working from Oregon this month -- working from ""home"" is so comfortable and versatile I got to spend the entire month of December here doing exactly what I would be doing in NYC but yet spending quality time with family that I don't get to see very often. I LOVED it. I love this quarantine lifestyle and the way it has made me more human and less like a machine."
13,journal-entry-6308," This is a hard question to answer. I personally have been dealing with a neurological disorder for the last 5.5 years. I wouldn’t necessarily classify myself as someone who is healthy. Although 2020 was a breakthrough year for me. I was finally diagnosed one month before the US went on lock down. I was supposed to start my treatment in April but it got pushed back and now I’m finally starting it February of 2021. With the pandemic it brought out anger because I was finally getting the help I needed but it was put on pause.  Because of the pandemic I actually took initiative to do stuff myself and see what I could accomplish. I came to conclusion that I can’t do much physical stuff at home with the lack of equipment but I can definitely work on my mental health well being. I took up different meditation methods, self help books and continued therapy. It was the year where I grew so much. I think the pandemic helped me with this since there was very little outside distractions. So I can say that at least I mentally feel the healthiest I’ve ever been."
14,journal-entry-6307, This past week was New Years. It was really annoying seeing everyone still getting together and having big parties knowing well enough this is extremely dangerous. Cases in my area are 1 in 4 people. The hospitals are being overwhelmed and yet here they are not caring one bit. This next month is going to be a big one because all the Holliday reunions are going to be the main cause of spreading. I’m just upset and done with telling others not to do it. You get  so much ‘FOMO’ and feel like you’re the only one who’s going by and actually listening and staying home. Online helps because you see others who are actually staying home as well which is great. I actually counted down the New Years with Snoop Dogg as he was hosting on TV and FaceTiming others in. I enjoyed it and it was a fun memory. I  just wish others would have stayed home..
15,journal-entry-5143," I normally study medicine in Germany. Now I am locked down in Greece, in Athens with my parents. Theoretically I could go back to Germany, but there is no point since all my classes are online and mostly power points, plus I have sublet my room in Germany hoping I would go for an erasmus (I had everything ready until they locked down Prague). I don't leave the house. Every day is the same. I can't see my friends even though I miss them a lot since I am mostly away and now that I got the chance to come to Greece, we are locked in our houses unable to see each other. I can't even go for a walk alone to the center, which I love so much and I miss Athens so much.

Sure, it has changed many of us, but for a child, a year is an eternity, especially developmentally. We're kind of frozen in time on a lot of things right now, but they can't be. I'm trying to imagine a year of my childhood like this--school over the computer, almost never seeing my friends, no sports, no dance classes, no vacations... What a profound impact that would have. I'm very concerned about the lifelong ramifications for children going through this pandemic."
17,journal-entry-6301,"January 1, 2021

 Happy New Year! Today is the start of a new year.  Too bad that it starts with the same problem that we had last year— a massive pandemic that is scheduled to get worse in the coming month.

 Last night was surreal. One would have expected all sorts of parties and fireworks. After all, the point of New Year’s Eve is to give the old year one last hurrah and start the new year off right. At the restaurant, we had fireworks all right. We churned out so many pizzas that our delivery response time was up to 2 1/2 hours. I had to answer the phone for call-in orders, and the first thing that I had to tell people was that their order would not be processed right away. Most were polite, even when they said no thanks to “Would you like to place your order now?” I also had to tell an old friend that I could not serve him until he at least showed me that he had a mask, since he entered the facilities without a mask despite the signs on the door noting that they are required. More fireworks came when I had to break up a large party and separate them into several tables because they had too many people. Our local guidelines for COVID-19 say that we can only have 10 people in a party. One vengeful Karina got mad and screamed discrimination. I ended up in the back of the kitchen making sauce cups.

The other part of the celebrations that made everything surreal was the fireworks. Someone shot off some sky rockets perilously close to the gas station behind the restaurant. I guess they didn’t care if everything caught fire and we didn’t survive. They also shot off fireworks near the Gonzales stockyards. Since there were no cattle sales this week, there were no animals to spook. I wish that I knew whether or not my little town shot off any fireworks in the city park like they have in past years. It would have made the whole thing seem more normal."
18,journal-entry-6285," My productivity in general has declined. I am finding it hard to concentrate--not just on my work, but on pleasures-- serious reading, drawing, my piano lessons. I spend too much time staring out windows, not thinking of anything really--moping as my mother would say. So much death, suffering and I don't know how we can recover, including a belief in a US government that works for its citizens' best interests. I suppose I also no longer believe most people are decent."

The way the wind fragrance my skin 

Sweat coating my body 

But loving how life’s scent makes me feel good

Inside myself struggling but finally relaxing

In the heat of my own body 

Generated within myself executed as I

Performing legs burning

Lungs on fire

Eyes watery from the wind

And yet it’s so lovely

To be a dearly beloved feeling

Lighting up inside myself

That no one can ever take away "
20,journal-entry-6292," As a researcher who is interested in how people understand health risks and make decisions about their own behavior, I'm fascinated by the parallels between Covid and the AIDS epidemic, particularly the stigma and the denialism.

 An acquaintance is a professional runner and Olympic hopeful who wrote an op-ed for Runner's World magazine about why she hasn't raced during the pandemic. She holds a master of public health degree and has felt that racing is too risky.

 A number of the comments on her article called her ""paranoid"" and ""self-righteous,"" and these commenters felt she was giving into fear and propaganda.

I remain extremely angry at the lack of presidential leadership that has sowed misinformation and distrust of scientists from the start of the pandemic. How many more thousands must die because of ignorance?"

We have developed an appreciation for online shopping and are grateful for the delivery trucks that rumble down our road. We do not dine in-house at restaurants; instead, once a week, we order online or via cellphone and then pick up our selections. Throughout it all, we have always worn masks, used hand sanitizer liberally and washed our hands fanatically. Like other Americans, however, we sometimes suffer from coronavirus burnout and pandemic fatigue and are growing weary of following precautions.

And really, that keeps me from drowning. Maybe tomorrow the virus mutates and it can't hurt us anymore. But maybe it doesn't. So... Perhaps this pandemic has forced me to be present more than ever. And that's something, right?"
23,journal-entry-6277," New Year's Eve. So many memories. Last NYE we drove 2 hours to a wedding. Little did we know what was going to happen in a couple of months. Actually, Covid was already in this country, waiting.

 This New Year must be better. When can we all be vaccinated?

It must be soon."
24,journal-entry-6258,"This is a note to the organizers of this project: I myself read the featured entries each week to see how other people are doing. it's sad and frustrating, but it makes me feel connected to others who are isolated, but also want a ""Clean"" (e.g unfiltered, uncensored) place to contribute to the discussion, which now feels a little like a community, as I am starting to recognize some of the entries by the writing style. So, thank you!"
25,journal-entry-6256," I absolutely don't feel like writing this week. Every time it feels like there's good news, it seems like bad news is ready to jump out behind it..

... we got the vaccine but now it's being rolled out at a snail's pace and people are trying to jump the line. There's nowhere near the doses the government promised. At our current pace of vaccinating 1 million per week we'll need six years to get the population vaccinated...

...the court cases were thrown out, the states voted to certify the election results, other governments have recognized Biden as the next president, the election should ALL be over. But Trump and his minions will not fucking give up trying to steal this election. Suing Pence to get him to not accept the states...senators declaring they will challenge the results on January 6.

--- Biden has put together a strong team of experts, and now the administration is blocking access again? How many days until January 20th?????

... so many stories about people having pandemic fatigue and just doing ""one little thing"" and then bringing the virus home and infecting their whole family.

--- my mother, in a nursing home, got the vaccine on Monday, as did all the staff, so my family was really happy, and then today we got news that four more residents have tested positive. About four per week are testing positive at this facility. At this rate, four cases per week, this nursing home is going to lose all of its residents. Each time they have new cases, the close the facility down. My mother tested positive in April and never had any physical symptoms, so we are praying she has some immunity. But I still worry about ALL those other people in this nursing home and everywhere. How can we be ten months into this pandemic and still have people going out, mixing, unmasked...

... my husband and I were getting along fine staying at home, and then  the other day I noticed all this extra food in the pantry. I knew he didn't buy it because he hadn't been out shopping, and I realized he'd taken it from one of those free food pantries. This made me so sad I can't even speak. At first he was defensive saying no one else was taking it, which made me even sadder, that he would still take it on principle. He has a job, is working from home and we've done very well in the stock market this year. We do not need free food. In his defense, his grandparents grew up very food insecure in a country that was just coming out of civil war, and his parents conveyed a lot of that anxiety to him. As he said to me, ""I can't help it, when I see free food it's really exciting."" I understand that we're in a pandemic and anything goes, but it made me so sad that at 56 he still hasn't dealt with this on a fundamental level. I made him take it all back and as soon as I finish this entry I'm going to make a donation to a local food bank.

... on my birthday about a month ago my best friend called me to apologize for missing my zoom party, saying ""things got tough at work."" That was fine, I know she has a tough job, so I reached out multiple times to check in. But then she didn't return my calls or emails for a whole month. I was extremely worried. I didn't know if she had ghosted me or was in crisis and the fact that she wouldn't reach out to me made me sad, like she couldn't trust me to help her, or worse, maybe she couldn't. I was just about to call one of her sisters, when she finally replied to my text apologizing for ""falling off the radar"" and told me that on Nov 25 (my birthday) one of her co-workers, who she'd been helping with treatment, had died of cancer. I know this isn't about me in anyway, but this made me so incredibly sad that instead of telling me she'd lost someone, she told me ""things got busy at work."" It made me sad that she couldn't trust me to be there for her, that maybe she didn't want to ruin my birthday with bad news? And it made me sad that because I was giving her space this month, that I wasn't able to do anything for her.

I feel really sad and worried this week. I want this week to end, for everyone to go home post-holiday, to stay home, for caseloads to go down, for people to STOP dying, for health care workers to be safe, for Biden to take over the white house and get the vaccines organized and take leadership for the benefit of the country, unlike the turd that's in charge now."
1,journal-entry-6286,"So... before the pandemic I would have long 12 hour days driving around to keep up with my 6-8 part time jobs that I had to juggle to barely make a 25k living. I would work tirelessly as a substitute teacher, grant writer, cheer coach, skating coach, anything anyone wanted me to be within reason as long as I could get paid to pay my bills.

 Fast forward to March 2020 : I quit most of these part time jobs for a full time job I wound up leaving due to a white supremacist leader who continues to be the CEO and it was so toxic I questioned what is sanity if not in the hands of my oppressors as a BIPOC queer disabled woman? Feeling broken and lost after pouring my heart and soul into my full time job with benefits, I jumped into a Distance Education Teacher position where I am currently at. I love my job. It is alot ...I still work 12 -14 hours a day for my kids. I am paid 20k less than my previous job simply because I do not have a teacher's cert. I have 3 Bachelors degrees, 1 masters and am working on my doctorate in the hopes I will be deemed worthy by someone to settle into a job that won't treat me less than shit or run me ragged like a hamster on a wheel.

Despite all of the change from moving out of my parents house into an apartment with my lover which we will soon be moving out of into a house together with my brother since it saves us hella money...I am tired.... I almost feel guilty saying hey you know I never got a break during this whole freaking pandemic. I want to scream at times saying it's not fair I am fighting here on the front lines and everyone keeps saying wow your amazing keep going...keep pushing...keep educating....keep being everything you are to everyone but who am I to myself anymore? I don't even know. I used to cry everyday just to get through and tell myself it will get better. And some moments have...but it is hard... I wish people would understand even though this pandemic has turned everything upside down to the point where I am working the same amount if not MORE so than I was working before online...I just want a break... I want to silence my phone...step away from taking care of people...step away from educating people....step away from myself for a little bit...but the world can't afford that right now and neither can I since we are all struggling through this together.

All in all.... I still work the same amount of hours if not more so now but in ways I never expected I was capable of."
2,journal-entry-2536,"I've been feeling a great deal of anxiousness but also excitement. I've been anxious since this all began because I didn't know where I was going to live once we were removed from campus. Things got really sticky with housing this summer and I had a few housing gaps. I was anxious because I knew that if I got infected, I'd be homeless again because no one would let me sleep on their couch.

Luckily, however, I was able to work things out and I did not get sick. Now I'm just anxious for it to happen all over again with the rising cases of COVID-19 on campus. I'm hoping the university doesn't remove us because I wouldn't know where else to go.

My mind is at peace now but it's still a bit messy. Part of me wants to relax and tell myself ""it's okay"" but another part of me has been--and still remains--in survival mode. It's hard to explain, but I will try my best:

 A lot of people underestimate the amount of homeless students on college campuses. COVID-19 is causing those numbers to increase significantly. It angers me to see that some people on campus do not care. There are so many consequences for independent students if the university has to close. That's what's bothering me the most right now. I'm trying to be a student, an employee, an RA, and an artist all while being homeless--sometimes it's a lot to handle. But I know that this time will eventually pass and I will have conquered these challenges. That's what keeps my mind at bay.

Otherwise, I am excited because I have been finding different ways to channel strength and cope with everything going on. I am excited to try these new manifestations and coping strategies to overcome my PTSD. So far, it's been going well in quarantine and I've been feeling very good. I've been a lot nicer to myself since quarantine started and I've also tried picking up new hobbies. This summer, I baked things from scratch for the first time and I started reading e-books. I'm more of a cake-from-a-box girl and paperback lover, but it's never too late to try something new!

In short, being kind to myself and finding new hobbies is the least I can do for myself. I've been practicing all quarantine. I'm realizing that it helps me to move forward."
3,journal-entry-6247," Christmas was weird. I am used to a big family gathering and this year it was just the two of us. I did a video remote present opening with my kids, but it made me sad to realize how much we're missing.

 January looms. It's my least favorite month is the best of times, but this year (as everything is) it's worse. Cold and dark, the heart of the winter, nothing to celebrate. I'm feeling more house-bound than ever.  All the activities that seemed adventurous and novel at the beginning of lockdown in the spring (baking, cooking) now hold no interest. I feel like I should be more productive, but right now I just can't."
4,journal-entry-6257," I think history books will tell it like it was --that first, China FUCKED up royally by suppressing the truth about the virus and let it get out. Then the books will talk about spread throughout Europe and how years of austerity and globalization made the world completely unprepared for this crisis. How politicians on the right ignored warnings for year from the scientists and cut funding to programs to prepare for this.

The books will talk about the countries that got things right, light South Korea and Tawaiin and New Zealand, because they had strong leaders and the population masked and followed the science and the citizens were willing to sacrifice.

Then the books will talk about how the countries with populist strongmen--the US, England, India and Brazil failed miserably. I can imagine my great-grandchildren--assuming there are any humans left by then on a climate destroyed planet-- will shake their heads when they read about the stupidity of the human race. How humanity could not pull together for a collective good. How a country like the US could let half a million people die (Because it will be at least that number).

 The books will also record the amazing scientific feat of producing the vaccine in under a year. This will be marked as a turning point, because if mRNA vaccines turn out to be this effective, they can be deployed against other viruses, existing and future. This, and the huge demographic shifts of where people live because of remote work, will be among the defining outcomes of the pandemic.

Finally, I hope, the books will quote from the UConn Pandemic Journaling Project to show the uncensored voices of people from around the world; their rage, sadness, frustration, grief, optimism, humor--all of it, so that future generations understand, how we experienced it, uncensored, and unfiltered, via media soundbites or social media posturing."

 COVID optimism: two new RNA vaccines are rolling out which gives people the sense that maybe the pandemic could come under control in the next six months or so. The first dose of the Pfizer-Bio-NTech vaccine in the U.S. — delivered from Belgium, manufactured via a Turkish-German couples' technology (the Bio-NTech) developed then together with Pfizer — was given to a Jamaica born nurse and head of critical care , Sandra Lindsay, at Northwell Long Island Jewish Medical Center, who in a lovely familiar light Jamaican accent gave a pep speech for everyone else. Dr. Anthony Fauci received one of the first Moderna vaccines also publically on TV a few days later. I take pleasure in the various nationalities and ethnicities involved as a feature of international scientific co-operations that have not succumbed to politician's nationalisms.

 V.M. from Brazil sends along a lovely short article she wrote for the journal Psicopatologia Fenomenologica Contemporanea's discussion section ""Experts' Opinion-- The World and COVID-19, in which she (i) reflects on the pandemic as exposing our existential sense of vulnerability (in distinction from economic precariousness), (ii) warns about the mental disorder pandemic which follows the physical one, and whose ""proportions we still do not know precisely, but we've been following in our patients"", and (iii) reflects upon the split experience of lived space (split between immersive/intense interactions on zoom, and then the self-reflective shock of coming back to one's physical self at home). She was one of the participants in the Friday Morning Seminar and she notes, ""I was revived by the resumption of contact and learning, and my work capacity became greater and I accelerated my projects, even though I remained in quarantine working alone online in Fortaleza."" Moreover, to her surprise, she felt positive results through seeing patients online, not only with those she had already seen in her office but also with new patients. She invokes Merleau-Ponty's ""Cézanne's paintings are more real than photography because reality is imprecise, it has multiple contours, it is always in movement and there is no separation between what is real and what is imaginary."" In a way, she muses, also in the ""virtual relationship there is also no separation between reality and the imaginary realm, but one constitutes the other.""

 Meanwhile S.'s brother in a nursing home in Illinois contracted COVID-19 [positive tests]-- it seems (they won't say how many) many in the facility and among the nursing staff have or have had bouts with it). In J.'s case he did not develop pneumonia (lungs are clear), but has suddenly fallen a few times (legs just collapsing), some coughing, sudden aggressiveness pushing help and food and meds away, unable to recognize what a phone is, or to hear S.'s voice; but yesterday suddenly seemed to have ""woken up"" and was able to speak on the phone. One of course does not know what is COVID, what is dementia, what is insulin disregulation, and what are the effects of the medications that are being adjusted for him. A reminder that COVID in nursing homes is not one thing: it's complicated.

 We have been planning how to get together with R. and A., almost committed to having lunch at the Harvest where they say the tables are six feet apart, but then after reading another piece on the dangers of such in-door dining,  they urged us to think better of it. Instead we will drive down to Providence and visit them at A.'s apartment, which seems less risky. A very risk-averse friend, K, called while we were there, and hearing we were inside an apartment, hung up. (Maybe just polite, 'not important, talk later', not wanting to interrupt; but also felt like: well! I won't see you for two weeks! We do only see them outside on the sidewalk six feet apart, but just as evidence of the efforts to calibrate risk and safety).

 In Israel, despite all the other dysfunctions (coalition government collapsed again), there seem to supplies of vaccine for everyone, health-care workers and nursing homes first, and already next week a 60-year old colleague has an appointment to get his (Pfizer he thinks). Here talk of short supplies, age for elders raised to 75."
8,journal-entry-6243," I feel like a blob most of the time.

I find it very difficult to go for walks - even more so now that it is generally cold, grey and wet outside.

I find it difficult to do the exercise things over YouTube. I think that I am not good. I don't feel flexible. I don't feel fit. I just feel like a giant blob trying to move.

And then professionally --- I am not doing what I trained to do, and then when there is the opportunity to do so as a volunteer, I am just too afraid to try. Which then circles back, do I really want to do this. Why am I suddenly so afraid? Why am I am not pushing forward with my dreams? What is really holding be back?

9,journal-entry-6209,"Well, I think they will write about how government and society failed in this crisis, making it far worse than it need have been.  I think (and who knows, maybe I will write something about this) that they should include the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on the poor, the working class, and people of color (to say nothing of those who fall into multiple categories). I also hope they will avoid facile comparisons to earlier periods in history in history--Americans who lived through World War II ultimately did all they did because the government made them, whether it was military service, blackouts, or rationing, and had the kind of government leadership needed to get through a crisis like this, unlike now."

School stopped,  and that startled me,  then a few days later, my job closed. That is when I knew that this pandemic would be big. I was so scared, especially for my parents who had to work.

She's been lucky to be at a school with the ability to have full-time, in person education. It's a small school with small classes and they have done a tremendous job keeping our kids, not only safe, but happy and curious in their education.

I think she was deliberately vague while she was sick so we wouldn't all worry about her, she only talked about her husband's symptoms.

15,journal-entry-6234," I've always had a hard time being cheery during the Christmas season. While everyone is bopping around all happy and embracing the festive spirit, holiday movies and music make my cry at the drop of a hat. I cannot help but perpetually think of the exact opposite of cheer. During the holiday season, I am counterintuitively attuned to the enormous numbers of starving, homeless, poor, unemployed and underemployed, sick, dying, or imperiled persons scraping to survive life on our planet every day. Songs and music tell us to revel in family, joyous reunion, feasts on tables. It's so out of touch. Also, every happy ending has to have a low spot from which to build up. The reality is the low spot is whole narrative for the vast majority. I wonder if the pandemic will help people be less cheery in a productively sensitive way, and that it sticks.

 I was wary of my fiance's request to go inside her mom's house a few days before Christmas for a 10 min visit; it was too cold to hang outside, and we don't go in for fear of unwittingly exchanging the virus one way or the other. I acquiesced, it was much longer than 10 min which should have triggered my anxiety but oddly didn't, and overall it was amazing. Then I felt awful that neither of us could hug her.

 Christmas morning Zoom session with my fiance's family was the best I could have hoped for - no tech glitches we couldn't overcome in a few minutes - but it was still lackluster. And then I sense one my fiance's siblings agreed to another session with another portion of the family at a certain time, which we ran up against; they kind of abruptly left, which prompted everyone else to feel compelled to depart. So when it was over, the time felt quite short compared to the typical Christmas morning bleeding into afternoon and evening. That was a big letdown.

 Christmas for me, personally, didn't feel super different, but I've been privileged to have my parents be part of a mutually exclusive pod since mid-March. However, I worry they're not nearly sensitive enough to the fact that C. didn't get to be with a single member of her family in person on Christmas.

My dad is in late 70s, and he's really starting to show some trouble moving around(likely due to inability to go to the gym, be physically active otherwise outside during New England winter, or be socially active at all). My mom's mental acuity hasn't fully returned since her cancer treatments ended mid-March, though I don't know how observant she'd be of my father's aging anyway. So now I'm faced with both the task of navigating this space: trying to get my mom to be less ornery toward my dad, helping them access what they need, having the awful discussions about end-of-life care. And nothing triggers my depression more than the thought of them dying, of not being around anymore."
16,journal-entry-6198," It has changed the holiday season... Altering, cancelling, or what was expected, anticipated, and valued. There are people I miss being with, something that ZOOM falls short of. We can still communicate, just no commune. When I think about  the first thing I want to do when we no longer have to abide by pandemic restrictions is to go on a hugging spree! And  then throw a party! I took a week off of the journal with the end of the fall semester, since I was pretty depleted. There isn't much about this year that I want to remember or really pay attention to. My anxiety level is up, my depressive symptoms have increased, along with insomnia. I made a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, and left both ham and cheese out on the counter overnight... I misplaced my ID and pass key for work today, only to find it hanging up on the door (put there so I wouldn't leave without it!)

I spend more time escaping the absurdities of the world today in murder mysteries and police procedurals, both on screen and in books. The best thing about the pandemic for me was the discovery of e-books at my local library. I can choose from books all over the state from my laptop. No more lost books, coffee spills (Contigo cheap silicone washers that expand with exposure to heat; with no replacement parts), or late fees. I don't have to drive to the library, either!

 I can't help thinking about someone I know who is very vulnerable to any passing pathogen. A talented musician who is self-isolating because he doesn't want to catch COVID, but is dying inside due to loneliness. He misses his therapy group, his volunteer work, and teaching music. ""I never thought my last days would be like this"" was the conclusion of our last conversation. Multiply him my millions.... Someone else has to brave the cold weather to ""visit"" their spouse at a care facility through the window...Yet another may never be able to see her mother alive again (she is in a care facility and her health is declining). So much to grieve over... The pandemic has attacked us right where we are most human; it has tried to rob us of our connectedness.

And yet witnessing one of the most vindictive scorched earth retreats in history.... Everything that can be done to make life difficult for the incoming administration is being done. Creating chaos by refusing to sign legislation that his staff helped draft, taking this country to the brink of insolvency and then signing it... There will be many glitches in the safety net programs that would have been more seamlessly funded without the grandstanding... I know people who never got their unemployment compensation. The moratorium on evictions was only extended for a month! That takes us into the coldest part of winter..."

 But here’s my gratitude:

No one I love is sick. My business is afloat. My mortgage is paid up after a few rough spring months.

We have at least 6 more months of this and we’re all tired. What sustains me:

Yoga. Qi gong. Daily meditation. Going to the office each day like things are still normal. Cooking healthy food. Talking with my neighbors at a distance.

 It’s just a year.

Hope we learn from it."
18,journal-entry-6170,"Most of my journal entries have been pretty personal, but I also want whoever reads this journal — my kids, my grandchildren, anyone else — to have a window onto the kinds of headlines we’ve been seeing and news we’ve been reading. I’ve found myself thinking more than ever about how family-centered and emotionally intense a holiday Christmas is, for good or for bad, for so many people around the world. Although it’s not my holiday, I’ve been thinking a lot about how devastating it must be to be apart, or to be navigating family fights about whether it is or isn’t ok to be together, or even — like hundreds of thousands of families around the world, including some interviewed for the WaPo article below — trying to celebrate after having lost a loved one, or even several. Lots of moving stories in that article, but I was really struck by the story of one woman who’s resident of the Atlanta area and an only child, and who lost her father and both of her grandparents to Covid in recent weeks. The article describes how instead of preparing traditional Christmas foods together this year with them, they’re all buried side by side in a family plot.

- Merry ‘Covid Christmas’?

Here’s another piece I read earlier today — about how confused and uncertain we all are about how to even protect ourselves and those we love. Also in the Washington Post:

- All I want for Christmas are covid-19 mandates - https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/23/all-i-want-christmas-are-covid-19-mandates/

Two other items in the news are burning in my mind.  One is the death this week of Dr. Susan Moore, a Black physician in Indiana who was hospitalized for Covid, denied pain meds she needed, and treated in not only a disparaging but ultimately a fatally dismissive way by physicians — professional colleagues in the medical guild! — who denied her voice, dismissed her authority (both of her own body and professionally), and quite frankly denied her humanity. She leaves behind a 19-year old son and two elderly parents struggling with dementia. She was the sole breadwinner for all of them, and now she’s gone because of COVID and racism — racist doctors, racist institutions, racist system. I first learned about her death on Twitter, and a day or so later it was written up in the New York Times. She posted a video about it on social media in which she talked about how she’s been treated, essentially predicting her own demise.

- Black Doctor Dies of Covid-19 After Complaining of Racist Treatment: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/us/susan-moore-black-doctor-indiana.html

The other news item I can’t get out of my mind is actually something I read about in a post here — about a social worker in Chicago, also a Black woman, who was arrested and handcuffed in her own home, naked, by a swarm of police who forced their way into her apartment in search of a suspect she didn’t know. The officers didn’t have a legitimate warrant, as one of the officers eventually admitted after stepping out of her apartment, with the bodycam running. This happened in 2019, but it sounds from the local Chicago coverage like she still hasn’t seen justice. In the journal entry I read here, a white woman (like me) wrote to express the horror and terror that this could happen, as well as the clear sense that it almost certainly would not happen to someone like her in the US because she’s white.

20,journal-entry-6183," Food for my husband and me during the pandemic has consumed time and provided bright spots as well. Getting food has felt different over the months, but food has always been available. Early on shoppers felt a sense of uncertainty, and that led to hoarding and to adjusting to the 'changing normal' at our local grocery store. Products were not always available; bare shelves were a new sensation. We adjusted and now don't think twice about wearing masks, following directional arrows down the aisles or social distancing.

 I do enjoy food preparation, so I've spent much time poring over recipe ideas. Plenty of time has been available for cooking and baking; that has helped to keep me busy as well as to add delicious coziness to our home. We've made a habit of lingering longer over our meals: plenty of reading of digital edition newspapers at breakfast, slower lunches as we watch the birds delighting in our bird feeders, dinner accompanied by world news, Jeopardy, and PBS Newshour. No fast-food here; no take-out. We enjoy healthy, homemade meals, but OH how we miss being able to meet friends for lunch or dinner! Here's to 2021!"

Only a few differences: instead of going to church on Christmas eve, we watched the service on the computer while sitting downstairs around the Christmas tree. Also, instead of spending time at the mall shopping for Christmas presents, most of the shopping was done online. I didn't like that part because I enjoy shopping for things in person, but it was OK for one year. I truly hope I don't have to shop this way next Christmas though. We spent the day eating, laughing, playing games, doing puzzles and enjoying family time. I am truly grateful that we got to be together after not being able to hang out all year."

 I am grateful that I am not just trying to launch a career right now. College students have been hugely impacted and have had their plans disrupted in a more drastic way. Moving back home is itself stressful for young adults and their parents."
23,journal-entry-6181," Last year I swung by acme @ 5th and Pine to purchase a roast to cook on Christmas after learning that my daughter and her boyfriend planned to be with me so I was not alone .

 I shopped in and out of the Italian Market and the Reading Terminal Market. I usually did some variation of the Italian traditional 7 fishes for Christmas Eve dinner.

 We now have food delivered to us, having someone shop in stores for us. Using Mercato we get foods from the Italian Market and Reading Terminal Market. Christmas Eve dinner. was an Italian “Sunday gravy” of meatballs and sausage frim the ReadingTerminal vendors and acme. None of it was shipped for or purchased @ a store by us.

 My daughter moved Nextdoor with her boyfriend in mid-March to help me shop like this, to keep me safe.  It was his desire to have a pot of meat and sauce to access over the holiday weekend.?we did the preparation and the crockpot did the rest.

 While people lament what is lost to them in breaking traditions, I’d say this freed us. We have been playing with his Christmas present, a card game : The Puns of Anarchy -what fun! It takes 3 to play. We are looking forward to playing frequently now that we have the hang of it. We laughed until we cried as we devised tricky responses. This has been such a fun Christmas.

PEACE - Peace on earth is a dream. After the painful four years under President Trump and the dreadful weeks since the election, I love the moments of peace I feel when President-Elect Biden talks of our needing to come together. We have more in common than we have differences. May the wonderful message have a trickle-down effect.

Abrazar cuando veo una persona que hacía mucho no podía saludar, darle un beso en su mejilla y sentir su beso en las mías, dejar de lado esta costumbre ha sido para mí catastrófico porque ha transformado las relaciones que normalmente teníamos, el afecto se ha visto diezmado y nos convertimos, o por lo menos yo, en una persona fría.  Paso mucho tiempo en mi casa y ya casi no me gusta salir, ¿para qué? ¿Para ver sólo sus rostros y escucharlos de lejos? En realidad no me interesa ese tipo de relaciones y prefiero no tenerlas.

Children use media to connect and socialize, so it will overtake in-person interaction and become the norm. Children will suffer long term due to the rules and mandates associated with COVID-19 and have a hard time becoming functioning adults unless things change soon."

She has family visiting the building which is such a frustration. They are from out of town. We are all sacrificing and yet some people think they are the exception to the rule. Yikes. About to have some amazing roast lamb and watching christmas favourites.  I miss joy and celebration - but I will say it was nice to sleep in our own bed and not wear a bra all day lol.

I feel really bad for all the people who last minute had their Christmas plans cancelled. All the people who needed to scramble to get food and decorations. All the people who will not see their loved ones. All the people that this date was a glimmer of hope, and now taken away.

It is also scary. I want to yell at the government. Why have they not taken things more seriously earlier?! How did we get to such a place?! When will you learn from the past few months? This is no longer March or April when we didn't know what stops things, what needs to happen. It is all your fault that we are in this state. It is your fault that so many people are angry. It is your fault that so many people are confused. It is your fault that so many people are dying.

Also all the people living in the country - WTF - wear a mask; stay home; wash your hands. I don't understand why there are still people (or how there are still people) who don't see this as serious; who don't see this as part of their responsibility.

I broke down this week unsure again if and when I will see my family. Yes vaccines are slowly getting given, but when will everyone get one. When can I travel. When will I get one. When will my family get one. So just feel sad and missing them deeply."
8,journal-entry-6143,"This week, a former co-worker underwent endovascular coiling to treat a brain aneurysm. At age 76, she was terrified of dying on the operating table. The day before surgery, she called and summoned me to her house. There on the front porch sat a freshly-baked pecan pie that was encased in a pastry caddy. I was quite overwhelmed that she would think of ME when she should have been concentrating on herself. That's the definition of a true friend. I am ever so thankful to report that she survived the surgery and is now safe at home. The power of prayer cannot be denied."
9,journal-entry-6134,"The pandemic has changed the way we buy food, but not drastically. The main differences are that we wear masks to shop, stand 6 feet away from others, wait in lines to get into some grocery stores, and wait in long lines to check out. Also, since my husband is over 60, he is eligible to shop during Senior Citizen hours and I tag along. This helps us to avoid the long lines I encounter during regular hours.

However, we are able to buy the food we want and need. I realize that this is not the case for many people, and the fact that both my husband and I are able to continue working is a huge factor in this. I hate that the pandemic has created and intensified food insecurity in our country.

The pandemic has changed the way we cook food, in an unexpected way. My father died 3 months ago. Although his death is not counted in the death toll from the pandemic, I believe that Coronavirus contributed to his death. After he had Coronavirus in the spring, he went rapidly down hill and many of his organs were greatly weakened, leading to his eventual death in September. For most of my adult life, he would cook extra food and send some home with me when I visited my parents. After my mother died, he stepped this up and contributed many meals - at least 1-2/week.

Since he got ill and then died, I have been cooking more than I used to. Many nights, all I had to do was heat up something he made and make vegetables to go with it. I really miss his cooking. I miss the food he used to make, much of it Italian. I also really miss how much it helped us out with planning and making weeknight meals. It wasn't until I started thinking about this prompt that I realized what a difference the loss of my my father has made in this aspect of my life."

The hardest part is not being able to be by their side to help them more. I can see some students who struggle with school, struggle with interaction and learning online.

 I have come to see (and I may not have done this without the enforced solitude and contemplation of COVID) how our lives are shaped by what might be considered the minor characters, that we are enriched, and protected by all the various people (not necessarily children, parents, lovers) that we meet, travel with throughout time."

We avoid going into any places, especially now with the numbers so high. Also, when we order our groceries, we order them for about two weeks at a time. We wipe everything down before putting them away.

For our food preparation, if we plan to share/give anything to anyone then we will wear masks while preparing the food and dishing it up.

 We will only eat outside with friends and family outside of our ""bubble"" and take all precautions to have each family ""bubble"" dish up from their own separate dishes and using separate utensils, while wearing masks. When we eat, we eat outside with 6 feet between family ""bubbles.""

 Right now, it's winter and it's way too cold outside, so we're not doing any dinners, etc. together with anyone. We just don't want to risk it.

This is the underlying issue of all social interactions--are you on the same page as someone else about staying safe, what is that page, and is that safe enough for (what kind of) interaction? We wonder how long it will take for our reaction to other people to shift from ""oh, no, another person--duck, run for cover, leave, avoid them"" back to ""Hi, other person, how's it going?"" How long until the panicky feeling you get when you have to wait in line at the pharmacy--""C'mon, I gotta get out of here, it's an enclosed space, hurry up!"" goes back to ""I'll just look at the headlines on the paper while I'm waiting.""

One print was sold after he did a Zoom tour of the gallery. A participant called to ask if she could come to the gallery and see the work. We allowed her, and her husband a short visit, with masks. We opened the doors and let air circulate.

The other print was sold to an acquaintance who happened to park in from of the bundling just as I was exiting the house I invited her in, for a brief period, with her mask on and she decided to purchase the piece of art.

Image of myself coming to me today: a tree that got hit by lightning. The blast was deafening and I am split apart. But now that there has been some silence after the blast, it's seeming calm and peaceful today and innocent life is still going on around me and today I can feel that I'm still alive and might grow again.

 The Zoom memorial had lovely moments but felt a lot more casual than a funeral would have been and it made me sad. People mostly spoke off the cuff instead of preparing something and I wished it had more dignity and intensity.

was exhausting and not that rewarding. But, nice that more people could participate than in person, and having a mute button can be really handy with a big group!

One attendee was actually out on a walk at the beginning and that felt offensive to me, not the decorum you expect for a memorial! I had hoped to look at my aunt's kind partner while I spoke but he had his camera off. That's just how it goes with Zoom gatherings.

I felt so depleted and exhausted afterwards.

He was a pleasant neighbor. May his memory be for a blessing.

20,journal-entry-6036," Oddly enough, I've been filled with gratitude this week.

 My dad passed away on Thursday. He went into the hospital the Saturday before that, and was there until Tuesday. Mercifully, the hospital let me in to see him on Tuesday, as we didn't know at that time whether the nursing home would let me in when he was about to transition. Our local hospital for the most part is not allowing visitors at this time, but they made an exception.

But as it turns out, when hospice assessed Dad on Thursday and they realized his time was near, the nursing home allowed me in. I got to see and hug my mom for the first time since the lockdown--the last time I hugged her was March 11. Dad stayed with us for 5.5 hours after I got there, so I was able to spend time with both of them, reminiscing over all our wonderful memories.

And he passed so peacefully. People talk about a ""death rattle"" when someone takes their last breath, but Dad's last breath was no different from the ones that immediately preceded it--a bit like his just-about-to-drift-off-to-sleep light snore. He was able to transition in a way that so many have been robbed of this year--surrounded by family, both in person and over the phone, comfortable, and awash in our love for him and his love for us.

 Grateful doesn't even begin to cover my feelings on being able to be present for his passing. He was 80 and had been on dialysis for around 5 years, so his passing was not a surprise. I spent most of this year fearing he would transition alone with Mom--that I would be barred from being there. In fact, their nursing home only just got a massive COVID outbreak under control. If he had passed even a week or two before this, they probably wouldn't have been able to let me in.

 I am so relieved that he is out of pain. That my mom somehow, miraculously, willed herself into lucidity because she knew he was dying and that she wanted, needed, to be mentally present as he passed. Her lucidity won't last. The deep sadness over the loss of my dad will come --for her, for me, for all of us. But considering how awful it could've been --he could've died in isolation, she could've been completely out of it mentally, I could've been barred from being there-- all I feel now is the love and joy for him. He's out of pain. He got to die on his own terms. And I was able to hold his hand as he took his last breath, as I watched his pulse through his carotid artery slow, and then stop. I could bear witness so Mom didn't have to. She was next to me, of course, but I took over the active watching because otherwise she would've, and I'm not sure she could've handled that.

 In COVID terms, though, this gives me a bit of something akin to survivor's guilt. Worldwide, nearly 2 million souls have already died agonizing deaths, alone and scared. Millions more have grieved the loss of those loved ones in similar isolation, apart from their families. And many others have lost their loved ones in similar circumstances simply because of COVID restrictions--their loved ones didn't die of COVID, but they still weren't allowed to be present because of safety concerns. I don't know why my dad and our family were spared that fate, but I'm immensely grateful for it. I only wish that everyone could die as dignified a death as my dad did--and I'm so terribly sorry so many won't."
21,journal-entry-6040," My most pressing issue is not being able to go home for Christmas.

 To travel home, we would have to go halfway across the country, including 4 meal stops and a night at a hotel.

My parent's house would usually have been our first stop, but my mom is a front-line worker who has seen how horrible this disease has been in her community and my dad is high risk with a laundry list of pre-existing conditions. They have been taking this very seriously and the last time I saw them in person was last Christmas. My mom told me in March that she didn't want me coming home for Christmas.

Our second stop would be to see my in-laws. They have been more relaxed in their response  and we have friends and family near them that are in the camp of people who are in denial. So if we were to make that stop we would be seeing dozens of people, about half of whom haven't been taking COVID seriously at all. They live in one of the current epicenters of the disease, St. Louis, MO.

I am nothing more than a sounding board for my sister's troubles, as there is nothing I can do to help her other than offer my sympathy.

 Meanwhile, here in Scotland, there is about 6 hours of daylight, none of which includes sunshine. it is grim. Of course I know it is grimmer in other places. It doesn't actually help, knowing that there are people worse off than you, when you are feeling blue; it just makes you feel selfish and ungrateful, which leads to further misery for being such a self-centred human being.

My friend's 90+ mother died nearby. The friend and her husband had moved to Arizona a couple of years ago. She got the call her mother was failing.

After 4 days I got a call from one of my friend's ... who was at that party. He said in his family there are 4 people who got COVID-19 positive. I was so worried, I'm still trying to have distance from my family member. because I'm not sure if I have it."
4,journal-entry-6021,"The loss of so many innocent lives to the Pandemic is starting to take a toll. I find myself crying at least once a day over a news segment about a “life well lived” and I’m sad but also angry because it didn’t have to be this way if we had leadership in the White House and/or Senate. It’s an absolute travesty what these people have unleashed on this Country. People have lost this jobs, lost their healthcare, facing eviction, foreclosure, during the holiday season, facing a pandemic. And DC is squabbling over whether to give people $600 or $1200 dollars. Unreal! People need thousands! I truly don’t understand the greed and callousness in DC.

And then I saw the video of the woman in Chicago who stood naked on body camera after the police kicked in her door. And it terrified me. As a woman living alone in the suburbs, I couldn’t IMAGINE how I would have reacted to the police kicking in my door, making me stand naked while they ignored me telling them they had the wrong address. And similar stories of families in Chicago where their door has been kicked in multiple times. As a white woman, I live insulated from this trauma. I’ve only ever heard of this happening to one person, a friend of a friend, but the police had the right place that time. Then I saw the outrageous amount of settlement money the city of Chicago has paid due to police wrongdoing. Chicago is a great city and gets so many things right, why is the CPD still such a disaster ?!?

Well, that was cathartic. Time to get back to cards and spreading Christmas cheer!"
5,journal-entry-6014,"The coronavirus pandemic hasn't affected my life this week because I am doing what I've been doing since March. I go to work, buy gas, and go shopping for food and basic supplies. My department had a pot-luck pizza luncheon and Christmas gift exchange this week. It felt normal to bake something and eat it with coworkers. We were in violation of pandemic rules that no homemade food was to be shared during the pandemic. We are law abiding citizens, but are tired of the control of basic liberties our country has placed on us.

We were offered a free COVID-19 test so I took it. It came back negative as expected."
6,journal-entry-6017," The city I live in has been incredibly diligent about mask ordinances, for which I'm grateful. I haven't been anywhere near as active publicly in said community because I've gotten rid of Facebook and moved away from a lot of the interactions I would have had otherwise.  I get the sense that people are isolating in more ways than one, much like myself."
7,journal-entry-6024," I am a painter, with a studio in a large artists building. The community there has been supportive and social. We always gathered for lunch at 1 o'clock in our common area. There was conversation, laughter, arguements, inspiration.

 Since the pandemic, our building is deserted. The few times I've gone in since March there's rarely anyone working. Of course, lunch gatherings are out, but even more crucial is the fact that very few artists I know are even motivated to make art. It's like the pandemic has sucked out our creativity or need to make art at all."
8,journal-entry-6027," The first snow in our area this week....and as a doc, that used to mean either being risky and trying to drive in to the office,  or simply moving all the appointments,  canceling the day (and having fun in the snow but not making any money).

 But hey, it's 2020---this snowstorm, I simply did telemedicine visits from my laptop at home  rather than from my desktop at the office. My staff worked from home, checking phone messages every hour or so, and communicating with me either by text or via our electronic medical record. So, patients still got seen, I still made some money, and we don't have to reschedule anyone!

 Covid made telemedicine rise to the forefront....about time. It's one of the silver linings in this pandemic!"
9,journal-entry-6008,I am scared. Watching everyone go about their lives like nothing is happening. I am scared that the hospitals will be overwhelmed and the healthcare workers quitting or having lasting mental health issues. And I we won’t have access to healthcare that we need. People are so selfish and the government has abandoned us. We are dying out here and no one cares. The economy is more important than lives. I am so sad and scared. 
10,journal-entry-5973,"I think the pandemic has been a great reminder that we are mere puny humans and that despite all the things we have achieved, we really do not control the universe nor do we have any idea what tomorrow will bring. It has been humbling at a massive scale. I think that many people, including myself, have started to see our lives differently-- we do not control everything, we can make plans but only God knows if they will happen. The pandemic has shifted my priorities-- I am more focused on relationships and things that will last-- rather than superficial encounters and entertainment. I feel like the pandemic has been a giant detox of sorts-- getting rid of all the toxic unnecessary clutter in my life and making room for those things that really important, that nourish me, and I genuinely care about."
11,journal-entry-6005," Community? What community? I never see anyone.

 In some ways, yes. But even in my cohousing community, it mostly feels as though people are looking after themselves, and community discussion about COVID is mostly about the higher-risk people making sure they are not put at risk by others. All framed as 'keeping the community safe"" of course. People probably do things I don't see: shop for our elders, etc. There was a charged discussion about whether someone needed to tell the community if they got sick. Mostly everyone makes their own decisions about risk."
12,journal-entry-6004,"It's hard to shop for Christmas stocking presents online! (Even harder to get them where they need to go in a timely way.)

 My two-person ""pod' is at risk. My young friend wants to sign up to be a teacher's aide, in person. That means she'd be at risk several days each week, which would make it hard/impossible for us to continue to live togehter. That's a pretty scary prospect: I've certainly lived alone, but not pandemic-alone. But my job is to be a good mom-equivalent, so I can't try to influence her.

 If it weren't for the pandemic I'd be in Georgia canvassing! Aarghh. The limits on hand-on helping is so frustrating. Same with climate: no direct action, no civil disobedience. The stuff we can do feels so pale compared to the need for action. But it feels stupid to risk COVID for a sit-in."

14,journal-entry-5960," Work oddly became a visceral struggle for me, though the issue is arguably small in impact/scale. My office is trying to create a virtual ""holiday"" gathering. I'm doing my best to walk-back ""holiday"" in recognition of how many that leaves out (Diwali was early last month, Ramadan is in summer, etc.) and how symbols of Christianity generally pervade despite people's efforts to try and keep things ""diverse.""  Coordination around this event is BAD, things are being thrust upon me in the 11th hour, and I worry about being associated with poorly-designed material; I'm partly a professional event coordinator, after all, and this could reflect poorly on me.

 And then there's the double-speak from my employer about internet and winter weather. If in-person classes are cancelled due to bad weather, then so too are online courses. Staff who have been telecommuting during the pandemic will be expected to work during the bad weather, because they can work from home. The cognitive dissonance here astounds me. I almost don't care which way it goes, but something needs to get balanced out here."
15,journal-entry-5957," Although Christmas is in the air, perhaps the joy of the yuletide isn't in our hearts as much as in previous holiday seasons. Due to the pandemic, families world-wide are facing long separations. Businesses have closed, leaving many without jobs. COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to skyrocket. Yes, a vaccine is definitely a step in the right direction, but above all, we need to band together, strictly observe pandemic protocols and defeat this threat to humanity. Only then can true joy return to our lives."

As I pull the bow off my present

It slips off like the red low back dress I wear

Fluttering around me as a cold breeze dances on my skin.

As I pull the bow off my present

I think about the memories I have with presents

A gift of the now in how I can seize the moment of who I am a mirror of who I used to be

Fluttering around me as a cold breeze dances on my skin.

As I pull the bow off my present 

Red always comes to mind, during the holiday times in winter

Kwanzaa, Christmas, and Valentines galore filling up the air with a sweet scent

Fluttering around me as a cold breeze dances on my skin. 

As I pull the bow off my present

I think about the joy and love I put into making it

The hard earned coins from my blood, sweat, and tears that I put into getting the materials 

Fluttering around me as a cold breeze dances on my skin.

It is spilt monthly to detox from the inside out

17,journal-entry-5983," I thing there are a lot of stupid people in the world. I will not mince words here. The things people say and do pertaining to this virus are outrageous. I also think many people are selfish.

 Taiwan has 25 million people and their covid cases are about two dozen. Why? there were strict rules that everyone abided by.

Many Americans are just ignorant. Saying that the virus is a hox, or that they won't wear a mask because it impinges on their freedom, is just stupid.

So I feel there are a lot of stupid people in the world."
18,journal-entry-5928," I'm glad for this question; until I wrote this and re-read it I didn't realize that I was actively seeking all these sources of support!

 At the beginning of the pandemic I was stranded overseas. A very kind person added me to a local whatsapp group so I wouldn't feel Isolated so far from home, and it truly was a lifesaver to have that connection to the outside world. It was made up of about twenty local women and it was like a virtual village--advice, jokes, photos, support--all of it. I then created my own group with some friends back home to help me feel connected to them and to focus on positive and humorous posts--and we've had some great laughs with all the fabulous satire and jokes that people have developed. So, Whatsapp groups have been a lifesaver.

 Zoom has also been a lifesaver.  My family is dispersed from California to the east coast to Europe so getting together is challenging anyway, But with Zoom we meet about every six weeks for some holiday or someone's birthday...and that's kept us all connected. Same with my friends who are far more open to gathering on zoom or video chats. It's a really nice way to stay connected.

Finally, I always look for things that are positive or innovative to help distract me or keep me from getting too sad or help bridge me across the next few weeks as I need to have something to keep me hopeful. For example, WXPN in Philly ran a poll of its listeners for the top 2020 songs of all times and are now playing them and counting them down--it's great fun listening to all these old songs from the 60s and 70s I have not heard in ages...(As a total aside Joan Armatrading just did a PSA for the station--i had NO idea she was British!). Of course there is also the  late night comedy, which has been a total life saver. I wish I could take a bite of Trevor Noah. He is so smart and funny and adorable!

 I've also learned which friends to rely on at various times. For example, I have one friend who loves to kvetch so when I 'm down I call her and we bitch for hours. I have other friends who like to focus more on positive things so I call them when I'm looking to be happy.

I rely really heavily on three papers--the Washington Post, the New York Times, and The Guardian for a range. Their reporting has been outstanding on the virus. I feel better when I am informed and I feel pretty well up to speed with these three papers.

Finally, there is my family. My spouse has been very solid and supportive, giving me lots of back rubs when I am stressed. My grown kids (21 and 25) have also been very focused, attentive and emotionally present. My mother, with early dementia, is deteriorating quite a lot, and so I talk frequently with my older brother too, who lives in Boston, and that's been comforting. We've grown a lot closer over the year."
19,journal-entry-5948," One positive thing that has come from this pandemic is that I rediscovered my love of reading. With little else to do it has been a great way to spend time and escape. It also is one of the things I can still do that doesn't require looking at a screen. I just hit my goal to read 14 books this year, which is more than I've read since middle school."

My mom was ok after quarantine - and now her school doesn't go back in person till mid-January, maybe. Which I am so happy about.

My sister was then in quarantine. But will go back to school.

21,journal-entry-5927," Last Friday was the second night of Chanukah and I'd invited my daughter and her boyfriend over a week or two earlier, before the post Thanksgiving surge took off. So I spent all week and all day agonizing and worrying if I'd made a mistake, if we needed to wear masks. My husband was really relaxed and said ""don't worry"" but my son was annoyed and worried. In the end we didn't wear masks and we had a really nice evening but I felt really guilty that we were mixing households when everyone kept saying not to. On the other hand, they are the only two people we allow in the house unmasked, we've been bubbling with them for weeks now, so probably it was okay.

Anyway, I woke up Saturday SO stressed. I had that feeling like after you've had unprotected sex, where you've really enjoyed yourself but you know you're possibly going to pay for it a few weeks down the line.

Anyway, it's five days later, no one has any symptoms, we're all avid maskers and hand washers and our state is so far, still at a decent (7%) positivity rate.

 There, see how I rationalized that? There's so much false logic in all of our thinking with this. It's so hard to live with something that in some ways is so far out of our control.

God, I just can't wait for this to be over.

Yesterday, Monday, December 14, was a really good day. The Electoral College did what it was supposed to and elected Joe Biden. And the vaccines started making their way into people's arms...It feels like the very beginning of the end--although everyone's saying the next few months are going to be awful. I just pray (in a secular way, that is) that my family and friends all stay safe."

23,journal-entry-5906," In the past week my niece in IL revealed that 4 of her family of 5 have tested positive for covid-19. She posted this on Facebook. Their degree of symptomatology varied from mild through debilitating headache. They had not been happy @ being quarantined. Apparently this occurred after my 80 year old brother and wife had visited on their way home to the west coast. A daughter had shared food with a friend who was positive yet she failed to test positive.

A result was a niece and nephew living in TN revealed they, too, had been previously diagnosed with Covid-19- apparently after a Halloween party. I’d questioned their party plans when my younger brother said they’d visited and were borrowing his flight suit for their Halloween party Top Gun costumes . When I expressed surprise that they would participate in a party my brother minimized the risk, saying it was only with their neighbors.

 Then my cousin in PA revealed that she and her husband had both been covid-19 positives; this revelation was also via the original FaceBook post by my niece…. I’m not surprised at this. Yes a rabid Truper who has railed against mask wearing, quarantine and physical distancing, vowing to hug whomever she wishes and attend church assemblies. She is a Christian Nationalist and believes the conspiracies Trump’s delusions broadcast.

In each case the adult male seemed to have a more severe case than their wife -although it’s possible that women cope better with pain and under-report discomfort.

 A friend’s mother was transferred from her SNF to a hospital ICU. The mother had dementia and has been  unable to encode why her daughter failed to visit her ( unable due to quarantine of nursing home). She died.

 My friend had reached out for support on Facebook and was appreciative of the prayers and concern expressed by others. It’s interesting that FaceBook can be so useful like this @ a time when we are forced to be separated and grief-stricken.

In the past week my honey reports his married cousins both have been positive. in PA Dutch area .

I’ve remained quarantined since 3/21/20 but he has not. His business is not one with a high degree of contact bothers and he shops when stores first open, limiting contact & shopping when stores should be cleanest. men seem to minimize the risk for contagion. Their seems to be some sense that the people we know wouldn’t have the virus … they also believe the Trump bs & minimization.

Vaccination started this week (yesterday). Distribution and the funds for this haven’t seemed to have been funded as needed and the first vaccine needs special cold storage & two successive vaccinations.

Meanwhile, we now have over 300,00 who’ve died.

As I write this I’m getting a news flash that there is a new mutant strain of Covid-19 and it is spreading rapidly.

I’ll be continuing to stay in & have food and supplies delivered. Guess I’ll book my post Labor Day shore cottage and think ahead longer term. When this first started (mid-March 2020) a friend asked me if our quarantine wouldn’t end in about 3 weeks. I’d said no, & estimated about 3 months... I hope it’s not 3 years."
24,journal-entry-5895," All I have wanted since I was furloughed from my retail job is to feel that I have a purpose. When working, I have a purpose, helping customers, my co-workers and following through on my responsibilities at the store. I have not worked since the last week of February and I am in awe of how much time has passed. I am lucky that my co-workers are an extension of my family and we are in touch and I have visited the store a few times to see those who are working. It is beyond difficult to feel one has no purpose. I take care of many aspects of our home, but I am no housewife! Making a nice dinner for my husband and daughter does not give me purpose, but I wish it did.

 Let these vaccines move forward and let this come to a place where we are all safer and I can regain what I define as my purpose, to return to work and feel some sort of normalcy once again."

I had two memorial gatherings for me this week where I got to say kaddish, the memorial prayer. I think more people attended because of its being over Zoom.

 A friend went to a Chanukah party that was a drive-in event and said she really enjoyed the way they did it, with Chanukah trivia (turn your right blinker on if this is true, left if false...) and streamed a concert for everyone. What a sweet way to handle gathering during the pandemic."

2,journal-entry-5848," I went crystal digging in Arkansas with my high school friend several years. We were unable to go this year because of the pandemic and risks associated with traveling. We probably won’t go this coming spring due to the pandemic. Crystal digging has been the only vacation for me, so I really miss it.

 The arts council I belong to normally has an annual beer and food tasting event that raises funds to have the Old Time Music Festival in June. The BrewFest and Old Time Festival were both canceled in 2020. We will not have BrewFest in March because of the pandemic. We hope to have a scaled back music festival of one day but are unsure if it will be allowed in June. I coordinate BrewFest, so I need to find another way to raise funds to keep the festival going.

 I would like to see my 89 year-old mother and family in another state, but no one is allowed to visit nursing home residents, and the counties where they reside are virus hotspots.

These things don’t appear to be major but when you don’t have a large circle of family and friends, the little things are important."

Mi abuela no ha salido de su casa y pude verla luego de unos meses.

Mi novio no salía de su casa pero si sus padres por sus trabajos, y tambien se cuidaban tanto como podían, también pude verlo luego de casi un mes.

I've been lucky to start new work that is meaningful and fulfilling and to connect with great people even if it's not in person. Perhaps that's also due to the pandemic because people have a different feeling now towards everyone, it's easier to get close to people more quickly over Skype. Everyone is glad to have that connection at least. Teaching online feels ever more like therapy to my adult students--but I'm happy to be there for them. Sometimes I'm sure I'm easy for them to open up to because I'm in that liminal position of fulfilling a proper role in their lives but I'm also a stranger whom they'll never meet--it helps me put my own problems and worries into perspective as I learn about their situation, so it helps to ground me.

13,journal-entry-5727," As we are entering the ninth month of the pandemic here in Europe, I would like to look back.

Sars-Cov2 has started affecting me personally in February. Disruptions in the supply chain of face masks used at my workplace forced us to stop seeing patients in mid-February. This was a big blow to my postgraduate program since I had already gotten flack and blocked from seeing patients for three months in 2019.

 We had to close the University from March to May during the first wave of the pandemic. Those were difficult months for me. I am someone who is used to keeping busy in order to help me with my mental health. Summer brought some better days and made us able to see friends. The constant stress and the mounting death toll around the world have made keeping up with the information a complete nightmare. Experts feel like they are too scared to utter the words ""we don't know"". We humans have been too terrified to hear them anyway. It was clear to me in September that a second wave is on the way. I found the month of September and October very difficult. Social media and news have made me tired and I have run out of outrage about the state of the pandemic and our way of organizing the human populations. I have gone back to a full-time work mode last month of November. It's helping me keeping busy but it also means that I come in contact with a lot more people and taking more risks. I don't like it but I have no choice. There is a lot I want to say but I guess I will have time. I am still traveling between the two cities where I work and live which are Paris and Amsterdam. The differences are interesting and very telling. I will try to talk about it soon."

17,journal-entry-5730," I’m really fearful about the history books. It looks like there will so many versions of the truth to be remembered. The pandemic and the politics of the day will be intertwined, since one can hardly think about the pandemic and not regard the ways it was mishandled by a self serving president who cares nothing about his populace and the fragil political world in our democracy. Unfortunately there are some members of a phony press that will continue long after a new president is inaugurated and continue to follow a failed president in the aftermath. There will be history books that largely blame the POTUS for extent of the effects of Covid on our society, medically, economically and politically. And there will be the books which portray the president as the unfortunate victim of a democratic hoax perpetrated on Trump and making him the hero of the year.

 Our wonderful communication systems have allowed a plethora of “news” sources to develop and widely broadcast information that is erroneous, misinterpreted and just plain laden with lies and imagined hoaxes. This freedom of press is a very dangerous thing when it is evident that we are an undiscerning public who might believe anything. I’d say that our school systems have fail d to educate people. People evidently don’t question the validity or the quality of their chosen news sources or their history books. We ought to be more aware of the fact that on line and on tv material should be tested for truth and validity.

Unfortunately the end result of the power of this dreadful president may rely on the result of a runoff election of two Georgia senators. The history books may be greatly influenced by this race. If the Democrats win, Joe Biden will have a better chance of fixing some of the wrongs done in the Trump years. If the Republicans win Biden will be stymied by his senate and it will fortify Trump republicans for the future and a possible run for the presidency in four years. History is being written as we watch it day by day. That very fact increases my anxiety and makes me feel impotent.  What can be done to right the wrongs of the last four years? Are we as Americans wise enough to make the right choices to protect democracy and make it function as it was intended? There is a basic understanding of democracy and that is that those elected want what is good, what is fair, what is best for all of the people. We have made some bad mistakes at the voting booth. That will be written in the books that tell the truth."

El problema no era solo el salir a un lugar público a beber algo, sino el hecho de tener que movilizarme a la ciudad vecina.

Todo el tiempo me sentí bien, tranquila, me sentía segura de las medidas que había tomado para protegerme y cuidar también a mis acompañantes; pero debo admitir que sufrí mucha ansiedad al ver tantas personas en un mismo lugar sin barbijos y movilizandosé por el local tocando todo y no sanitizarse después. La mayoría jóvenes adultos.

Esas circunstancias me hacen pensar, si sólo yo me cuido...  ¿qué tan útil me resulta cuidarme si todos a mi alrededor no lo hacen? Es difícil evitar algo cuando todos los demás no dan algo de sí para ayudar. "
19,journal-entry-5715," I have been overweight most of my adult life. As I aged the family inherited illnesses kicked in: diabetes ( because Native Hawaiian) and adult onset asthma. I also have high triglycerides like my dad and thyroid issues like my mom.

 Exercising is not my favorite activity but I had found something I liked to do on a weekly basis, and it was just enough to keep me mobile and free of aches and pains.

My illnesses do not overly effect my life at this time, I can still do everything I like to do, and I am fine as long as I take my meds and eat in a health manner.

 COVID-19 made my exercise program inaccessible and I have been slow to find a replacement. We try to walk the dogs for 30 minutes everyday and most days we manage it.

But I have aches and cramps I never use to have and I am not as limber as I once was.

 So I would say my physical health is declining due to lack of activity.  "

Nobody is trying to stop any war, people are still dying every day, people are loosing their jobs, immigrants and refuges are still looking for asylums, the power of the police is growing every day, the banks still demand the loans of the unpaid and unemployed people. So, TO ALL GOVERNMENTS, if you want the world to pause, then pause everything, not just the things that work for you."
21,journal-entry-5733,"Anxiety seems higher as cases, hospitalizations, and deaths surge. We stay home almost all the time and mask/distance when we do have to go out and I am still anxious about being exposed.

 I started tracking daily cases/deaths (USA, state, and county) in my planner a few months ago. I absorb information best when I am able to write it down and it's been a way to try to just take a moment and pay attention to the suffering and loss in that simple act. The reality is sometimes too big or hard to really understand, though; my own family has had only one very mild case in mid-summer and we have been lucky that all working family members are in essential worker positions (nurse, CNA, airport security), able to work from home (tech field), or in the military. The rest of us are retired.  Every single one of us has some kind of co-morbidity or are in a ""vulnerable"" group. Our family has been very, very lucky...but I am still waiting on that shoe to drop when one of us isn't so fortunate."
22,journal-entry-5760," I am curious about how history will treat this time. I only learned about the 1918 Flu epidemic sometime in the 1990's through watching old video tapes of Upstairs Downstairs.  It was only when this pandemic really descended that the 1918 Flu seemed to become more commonly written and spoken about.

 I hope that this pandemic is more commonly known in the future, especially the lessons that I hope we learn from it. First of all, the number of deaths we have experienced during this pandemic should be known, and emphasized, especially the suffering that people experienced. I also hope that the heroics of frontline workers is written about, and how many of them also lost their lives treating people who were sick.

The economic suffering should be written about - the loss of jobs and homes, the increased number of people who experienced food insecurity, and how people of color and poor people were most adversely impacted. I hope that included in that writing is the fact that in the US, Congress acted initially to lessen the blow to people who lost their jobs and then were unable to come to an agreement, and the suffering that this caused.

Any studies about the impact of social distancing and lockdowns on society, particularly children, should be included in historical perspectives of this pandemic. I hope that comparative studies about children's learning and socialization are included. If the pandemic permanently alters the behaviors of people within each society, that should also be known.

Last but not least, I hope that historians of the future compare and contrast how different countries responded to the impact, and how these responses determined how much the population of each country were impacted by the pandemic. In looking at this, they should also explore the amount of false information  that was present during the pandemic and how this shaped how people responded to restrictions and recommendations put in place.

I certainly hope that another pandemic like this one does not occur any time in the future, but if it does, I do  hope that the hard lessons learned during this pandemic shape the decisions of the future."
23,journal-entry-5744," I think that history books will describe this period in history as horrible. Trump plus Covid equals horror.

Hoy más que nunca quedó en evidencia lo alejados que están muchos de la tecnología, que digo tecnología, quedaron en evidencia la cantidad de estudiantes y empleados que no tiene ni luz eléctrica en sus hogares.

Son pocos quienes pudieron pasar la Cuarentena con esas oportunidades, el resto como siempre, fuera del sistema.  ¿La solución del gobierno? Apps para pedir ayudar ¡JA! Si tuvieran luz podría tal vez con suerte mandarte un mensaje de texto señor presidente.  Falta conectividad, faltan insumos, faltan muchas personas en el sistema de registro nacional de personas, sin luz ni agua no esperen ""Home Office"" ni ""Virtual School"".

2,journal-entry-5556," In the past three weeks, we've been on partial lock down. This mean that we need to limit movement outside, have no contacts out of our household and also, for me, being a teacher, that I need to stay at home and work online. It feels bad to be seeing my young students on a screen, struggling with keyboards and bad connections but it also is the highlight of my day. We joke a lot and I can tell they're happy to see me and their classmates. I can't help but feel blissful at all the benefits this situation generates for me: it saves me a two-hour per day commute, throat fatigue, mask fatigue and worrying about getting infected, when working at a school with 250 other people.

 I see friends online, or very rarely, one of them might break the rules and risk a 300 euro fine to come visit. The weather is still fairly warm, so we can sit at the balcony and pretend that nothing's wrong. Those are the best hours of the week-there's a mixture of excitement, pure joy for being able to meet and gratitude, but we also tend to look over our shoulders. Nothing is unadulterated from worry."
3,journal-entry-5546,"Recently, Governor Dewine has issued another statewide lockdown across Ohio. This has affected the night life lately and where people are allowed to do late night workouts such as myself. No more clubs, gyms, late night food spots and hangouts. This year has truly been a movie and we’re in the last quarter of it."
4,journal-entry-5535,"I experienced a lot of changes in my life due to the COVID pandemic. I am a current senior at a university, and unfortunately have been entirely online since last spring. During this pandemic I applied to graduate school, and I was unable to visit any of the schools beforehand. All interviews were held online, and for a student with subpar internet, that was really stressful. Luckily a program took a chance on me! I am now left with finishing out my semester remotely before I move on to graduate school, hopefully in person. I cannot imagine learning medicine online, but at this point I have learned that adaptability is a necessity for surviving this pandemic. As COVID continues to worsen, I fear that my learning will continue to be fully online for many semesters to come and hinder my ability to practice medicine in the future.

Financially, COVID has been a struggle for me among many others. I worked in nursing prior to the pandemic, but because of my other job in medical administration I was not able to continue due to the extremely high risk of contracting COVID and passing it to my other coworkers. Luckily, I stumbled across a new position as a COVID screener at a local museum, which as helped supplement my income. It has not been easy working two jobs and being a full-time student, but I am trying to count my blessings that I am able to attend a good university and have an income at all. I know that many others in the US and across the world are struggling severely due to this virus and all that I can do is be thankful for my blessed situation and continue moving along with life."

But the old, they almost never go out. Some evening, it was already dark, I saw the old lady from the first floor on a bench outside our building. I felt she was a bit surprised or even scared that I entered the building. I thought, maybe she forgot that other people are living in the building. Maybe I also forgot about her."

7,journal-entry-5549," I am really feeling the effect of the sustained pandemic right now. The area where I live is in so-called ""lockdown"" but it has become fairly political, with news breaking about policy differing from public health recommendations. It is very important for my work that I stay abreast of the news about COVID-19, but I do find it exhausting sometimes, and it can be hard to put it aside.

In a general sense, nearly everything about my life feels like it is affected! I am lucky enough to work from home, but that means I don't leave my house very often, only prioritizing the really important interactions. I do all my grocery shopping through contact-less click and collect and only venture into public indoor spaces when absolutely necessary. This will be my first Christmas season ever not celebrating with my family of origin, which is really difficult. They are a four hour flight away, and I cannot justify the risk to myself and to my parents in their 60s, not to mention a family member with asthma.

 A small but very real thing: even though I'm home all the time, I find it much harder to keep my house clean! We eat here 3 meals a day now, and in general use the house constantly. It creates so much more work!"
8,journal-entry-5551," England has now officially come out of the one month lockdown it was in, but my county (Kent) is in the ‘Tier’ that denotes the highest level of precaution must still be taken - tier 3. This means that the last week of the semester, which was supposed to be in person classes, has to be online after all. I am going home in one week. The government has offered a travel window where university students were preferred to go home between the 3rd-9th of December but I am not going until the 11th as I had already booked a ticket that was non refundable and anyway if I had had to buy a ticket within this window of dates it would be £130 rather than £30 which is just too much of a difference. But even though I am going home a little bit after the window, it still leaves me two weeks to quarantine at home and then hopefully I will be fine to see my grandparents on Christmas as the one other family you can spend it with. Technically up to three households can unite for Christmas but this year for the first time in a decade we are keeping it small with just my parents, brother, me and my grandparents (who my parents are the carers for anyway). I am looking forward to a small Christmas. Last year we had a big one including a family friend who brought her very excitable and non-litter trained poodles. It nearly caused a big fight because my dad doesn’t like dogs and was furious the friend wouldn’t take them out enough to stop them excreting inside. Maybe it sounds bad but lockdown measures have been a convenient excuse to not be able to invite lots of people to Christmas as we would normally feel pressured to do. I think my dad in particular will have a lot happier of a time this year and get the Christmas he really wants."
9,journal-entry-5575," It scares me, and confuses me, that people are so much less cautious now, when the pandemic is worse than it's ever been, than they were in March, when one local case would cause people to panic. We need to be every bit as panicked as we all were in March. I know we're tired of it, and it no longer seems novel (no pun intended), but we need March energy right now, desperately. It doesn't make any sense that there has been an inverse relationship between number of cases and amount of caution people take. I don't get it at all.

 I'm also scared that people will drop their guard once the vaccines roll out. It will take some time to develop herd immunity even after many people have been vaccinated. I'm scared that people will start partying without masks and the like too soon, and it will be devastating.

 It scares me that by the time spring comes, it's pretty likely that almost everyone will know someone who got very sick, or died.

I had my first personal connection to the disease. My cousin has it. We're not close; she's about ten or fifteen years older than I am, I can't remember exactly. I remember being a very little kid hanging out in her teenage bedroom. I've had very little contact with her since I was little. She hasn't been being careful; she's a Trump supporter who thinks all of this is a hoax. But now she's sick, mild at first but getting worse. I'm scared for her, for our family.

I'm also scared that the economic fallout of this pandemic will only continue to get worse, and people will only continue to get more desperate. The rich will keep fortifying their shelters or whatever because they know the world is ending--they even seem to wish for it. The rest of us will continue getting poorer. The numbers support this, but  even anecdotally, I know that actual hunger has penetrated my educated, middle-class bubble. I've only told one other person about this because I'm so embarrassed that it happened, but I got robbed recently. This is a situation I never, ever imagined growing up as a middle class kid in the 1990s. It's only going to get worse."
10,journal-entry-5571," This has been a week of relatively intense reflections about COVID-19 and its unveilings of not just the  inequalities in society and the cruelties of the governments in the U.S., Brazil, India, and elsewhere (which are increasingly becoming pundit discourses), but of a grammar of the bio-social immune system under great stress from multiple insults. I take this language from an extraordinarily rich paper delivered at our Friday Morning Seminar by O. B., which began with a recitation of events in Iran culled from tweets, conversations with physicians and other friends in Iran, attention to official statements (often in conflict with other sources) as they have been unfolding since February, beginning with reports from a hospital in Qum and journalist tweets and the arrest of those who let out the information followed by an announcement of cessation of flights to China (although unofficially Mahan Air continued with some 55 more flights) -- it began like a deja vu not only of previous epidemics in Iran, but like Wuhan and China's attempts to deny and stonewall, and then the fast spread outside Qum to other cities and to surrounding countries -- Iran becoming the 2nd major hotspot of what would become a global pandemic. While the securitization of health data is long-standing in Iran, it begins to look not unlike the attacks on authoritative knowledge collected by medical scientists and epidemiologists by the U.S. government under Trump. Is there a new grammar of biosocial control, but also of (psychoanalytic and psychopolitical) fantasies of what is going on? In Iran, this year is spoken of as a dark year -- the airliner shot down by IRRGC which just happened to be full of young students returning to universities abroad; the thousands of working class people shot in quelling gasoline price hike protests; the insulin shortage due to the trafficking of insulin abroad as the value of the rial/toman drops, the use of health workers as human shields against the virus in weakened bodies, weakened by diabetes, heart disease, etc.

 Reading Octavia Butler's two books Sower of Seeds and Sower of Talents is one of those astonishing fiction premonitions from the 1990s of what we are going through today with a candidate who is going to make America Great Again [Reagan's slogan of course] bolstered by evangelical extremists, and the collpase of the environment and social structure in the aftermath of the great Pox. But reading Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad deepens the historical continuities of the post Reconstruction white supremacy regimes that the Republicans are attempting to re-install in naked form -- the new Biden-Harris Administration will push back with what look like a series of superb appointments -- but the Trump years and COVID-19 are a stark warning.

To widen the range of the dystopia we inherit and inhabit I also just finished the trilogy by Zimbabwean Tsitsi Dangarembga of what colonization felt like and the rigors of de-colonialism, and Tommy Orange's ""There There"" (Gertrude Stein: there's no there there), both of which end in catacylsm.

All different but in some ways part of the same complex grammar that OB described and that are parts of our interconnected worlds.

All parts also of where my head has been as we wrap up the classes on Ethnographic Methods in Medical Anthropology for physicians from from Rwanda, West Africa, Peru, Myanmar, etc.; and on Colonial Encounters, Postcolonial Disorders with people from an equally wide range of background including two Native Americans, and which dealt with such discourses as white settler societies, historical trauma, decolonizing the mind, PTSD, hauntology, ceremony as healing and counter- or supplement to biomedicine's limitiations and incomprehensions.

 There is light and hope, but it will take work. "
11,journal-entry-5568," I haven't been to a church service since things opened back up. There are still too many people in attendance. Since cases are surging, I am cautious about exposing myself to a large group of people. While I am grateful for Zoom and livestreaming, there is much that I miss about weekly worship. My small group changed the meeting time, and I can barely get home in time. I am not singing as much. I miss Communion. The communal aspect of my faith is a core component.

This is the second Advent season that we haven't had daily reflections at work. I looked forward to how other workers integrated their faith and work with the readings from the Lectionary. There is a different feel to the week. I feel that just as m personal circle shrunk, so too has worship. I find that I have to turn to more solitary practices of faith."
12,journal-entry-5572,"Well, It's starting to feel a little like a rabbit hole now. In we go, and in we stay. Every night now I'm having a similar dream, in that I'm somewhere in public, and I don't have a mask and no one else does either. I wake up in a panic. The dream takes place in multiple settings--concerts, school, work, socializing with friends. Overall, it says the same thing to me: I'm scared, and this is our new reality.

This week my family made a decision to hunker down. We're getting food delivered and avoiding all indoor spaces as much as we can. The numbers are really frightening. I cannot get over the number of people who believe that it's their right to be ""Free' to not wear a mask, even it makes others sick and overwhelms the health professionals. I feel like I say the same thing every week, but every morning the news reports the same thing. This week we even had a couple that got on a flight from SFO to Hawaii, knowing they had tested positive. It is enough to make a misanthrope out of anyone!

I do feel lucky, though, My spouse has a steady job and we have savings. I have great, cheerful friends and we are keeping each other afloat via the phone.

 One thing I've had fun with this week. the NYT has a ""Calculator"" where you can put in your age, county, profession and health status and it will tell you approximately how many people are in front fo you for the vaccine. My 21 year old son and I both have 280 million people ahead of us for the vaccine. This made me laugh. We joked that he and I will be wearing masks for a LONG time. Meanwhile, my spouse, who works in the schools, only has 100 million people in front of him. And my daughter, who is graduating as a nurse, will be first in line as a health care worker.  I laugh because honestly, it's all so absurd, how badly we humans have failed this test as a supposedly advanced society. And if I didn't work to constantly find humor, I'd be so depressed I wouldn't get out of bed. I choose not to live that way. We will get out of this. It's just going to take a while."

14,journal-entry-5574," My workplace decided to go fully remote for December, so I decided to spend the month with my mom and step dad. It's a welcome change from living entirely on my own while mostly working from home (I'd been doing two days in-person, the rest of the week remote). On the one hand, it's a big adjustment not to have any alone time. But on the other hand, it's much better than being entirely alone. When the pandemic started, I didn't have any problem working fully remotely and living by myself. I wouldn't leave the house for weeks on end and felt totally fine. Sometime around September, I started to feel Not Fine.  I think this month living with them will help me cope with isolation in the spring, because it has made me appreciate the things I miss about living alone.

 I am scared, though. All three of us in this newly-combined household are being very careful and doing all the things we're supposed to be doing. And yet, it still feels like only a matter of time until we get sick. And then I'll feel guilty that maybe I'm the one who got it first, and I could have spared them by not staying with them. Or the opposite; what if I wouldn't have gotten sick if I'd just stayed home? It really feels inevitable that we'll all get sick, because I know a lot of people who've gotten sick who did everything they were supposed to do. I'm terrified, frankly."

16,journal-entry-5573," Oh, this is my favorite question.  I love it when the PJ folks ask this because I am a firm believer that we set our own reality in terms of mood, that we choose what we want to focus on, and if we focus on the things that make us happy, it can really help us feel happy!.

 So many things made me happy, I can't keep it to just one:

A colleague I really respect asked me to co-lead a writing group with her

A friend asked if she could hire me to help push her book out into the world

My daughter sent me three photos of her insanely adorable puppy

My 21-year-old son agreed to the new safety rules we discussed, without a fight.

I bought a new guitar that sounds beautiful. I wrote a few new songs on it.

I had a birthday party on zoom (Last week) and 12 of my friends showed up!

My family gathered by zoom for Thanksgiving and we played fun games

A friend gave me super helpful feedback on a chapter I've written

No one in my family tested positive for the virus

Trump is on his way out.

I reconnected with an old friend I have not talked to since seventh grade!!!

My friends are all staying strong and healthy, reaching out to one another

I got new bread making tools

I finished a few writing projects.

We celebrated my husband's birthday quietly, and he was really content with that.

17,journal-entry-5521," With this journal topic, I instantly think of my mother. To give context, she is Chinese and immigrated to the US in the 90's, and now works as a software developer. During the pandemic, she is definitely the most stressed out about it, which has been hard for me to understand. Throughout my time at home, there have always been restrictions: not allowed to see anyone outside of the house, wipe everything down with Clorox wipes, grocery shop with gloves on, and the list continues. She works from home and walks outside a lot, but rarely talks to other people outside of our family. I think her stress is fueled by the Chinese news that she reads, where they talk about more things to prevent infection. It's understandable why she is afraid of getting COVID, but I think most of the time she takes it a little too far. Even when I came home from school after getting tested, she was still convinced that somehow I was infected and stayed away from me. I worry about the impact this stress will have on her health, but no matter how many times I talk to her to lower her anxiety, it doesn't seem to work. The rest of my family seems to be less worried about the pandemic, but in our house, we adhere to her guidelines. I believe that COVID restrictions are completely necessary, but there is also a balance to where you still enjoy life and mitigate stress. With the optimistic news of a vaccine down the line, I hope that this will decrease my mother's stress."
18,journal-entry-5508," I stopped using Facebook 5 months ago, on my son's birthday. The day before, I started a bunch of arguments, and I didn't want to ruin his birthday by being sucked into my phone. After that, I just kind of dreaded logging on again, and the more time went by, the more I noticed the benefits to my mental health. And I noticed how much participating in social media had been making me get so angry at people - old friends, family, strangers, what have you.

Since then, I spent a little time on Reddit under a pseudonym, but even there, after a while I found myself just getting so pissed at people that I'd come online to notifications and just not be willing to even look at them. I haven't gone back there for probably a couple months.

 I have a twitter account, but I never post. I just watch some people that I think are funny or interesting. It's nice to see what gossip is going around, and how people are reacting to the news. Yeah, we can all read the news, but if you want to see what people think about it, you have to go to some form of social media these days. Even twitter is starting to ruin my days and make it hard to sleep at night, though.

I know there have been  happiness studies that found that the most reliable way to increase your happiness is to stop paying attention to the news. What does that say about current events? What does it say about the pursuit of happiness?

Of course social media sucks, and anyone can list the reasons why. But I think something about me has changed as the pandemic wears on as well, that has made me less tolerant of it. In normal times,  I was already the kind of guy who, if I went to a party, I'd have trouble sleeping for a night or two. I've just always been sensitive socially, in the sense that I'm easily overstimulated. And it's not like I can't adapt to more social contact - I've performed on stage, I've taught classes, I go out to plenty of things. But it's a level of tolerance that has to be maintained - I adapt to the level of social contact I have in my everyday life. And now, my threshold has dropped, probably to an all-time low, to the point where even social media contact is a little overwhelming. The only really surprising thing to me is the aggression I feel in response to it. I just get absolutely, head-swimmingly furious with people. I suppose that has to do with the way interactions are mediated through these platforms, because that's just never happened in person for me.

So, mostly I just stay away. I have a feed reader with all my favorite publications that I can scroll through whenever I feel the urge. I watch talks on Youtube, which can feel almost like a social gathering because everyone's in their house wearing sweats.  Andddd that's basically it."

20,journal-entry-5563," The dreams are back. When cases began to rise and we started isolating even more, the dreams came back. I can sleep well enough but I have these very vivid and unpleasant dreams that are with me when I wake up. This past night’s dream had me in a waiting room for hours.

 This year has been filled with death and loss. I am in my mid 40’s and so my parent’s generation is older. My friend’s parents are dying. Not of COVID but of cancer and other diseases.It’s a time when I think everyday we are living in a very special time. When all those we love are close."

23,journal-entry-5534," Currently, I don't find it too difficult to maintain social contact. I attribute this to how advanced technology has become. In addition to living with my younger brother and single mother, I keep in close contact with my high school friends and college friends. The pandemic has made it more difficult for me and my high school friends to see each other but we use the internet to contact instead. My brother and I still go on walks but at relatively abnormal hours to avoid any interactions with other people. Overall, the pandemic hasn't profoundly influenced by social contact and movement since technology has allowed for me to circumvent this problem."
24,journal-entry-5550,"While everyone is affected by COVID, the person in my life who has been most affected is my grandmother. She is 88 years old and lives in seniors' home. We are lucky that she is treated well but the isolation has made her really lonely I think it has negatively affected her physical health as well. Prior to the pandemic she was doing well health-wise and has really deteriorated recently. It makes me  sad that I might not see her again,  and she may well live the vast majority of the rest of her life alone. I think she's very depressed about it."

During the first spike back in April, two doors down actually dropped off a peach loaf with a nice little note that said if we need anything, to call them. I thought it was super sweet. I plan on reciprocating the love during this Christmastime. :) I do have to say I have wonderful neighbors."

I feel like those experiences gave me a new perspective about life and daily I try to remember the importance of enjoying what I can each day and to try not to take for granted the big and small things in life. And to keep up with my connections as much as possible with my friends, family, coworkers.

And then, more recently, I've started having what I call ""COVID"" dreams. In the dreams I'm doing everyday ordinary things like grocery shopping, or going for a walk, gathering with friends and family,  but nobody is wearing a mask, or physically distancing, or any of the things we're supposed to do to stay safe during the pandemic. And when I try to say something, everyone ignores me, and I keep ""wandering"" around like that until I wake up. It makes sense to me that I'm having these dreams, because I think everyday I have this underlying constant worry that everyone is doing what they need to in order to stay safe. Whether that's when I have to go out to run and errand, or I'm thinking of my loved ones. It's constant worry about exposure to something that's invisible."

Feeling drained, anxious, depressed.

Feeling old (for me) classic symptoms of depression...I don’t deserve to be happy, nothing I do makes a difference, why do I keep trying, nobody cares about my efforts.

 I’m tired. I’m hurting. And I know I’m one of thousands right now.  I know people have it worse than I do. Why should anyone care when I have an income, I have a roof over my head, I have my health (for now)?

But knowing these things doesn’t make the pain subside.

 I don’t want to work at a school right now. I don’t think anyone should be trying to teach right now. It’s too much expectation on the kids and the adults (parents and teachers alike). I can’t quit. I need the income.

 I’m sick and tired of being an American during this pandemic"

B and her family had to put their baby in day care because she can't care for him alone, and he got exposed to covid.

My circle has gotten smaller in every way.  On the one hand it’s great to really focus on what and who is most important to me, but I want to make sure I don’t get to comfortable in my cozy safe space and forget to care about the wider world and the people in it, especially those who are hungry or scared or abused or exploited."
8,journal-entry-5381," In the late 70’s I became a mother. My husband’s mother lay ill and dying 6 months into this. My husband was a free-lance photographer.  As he supported his father in keeping him company in a months long vigil, and was depressed, his business dwindled and dropped to virtually nothing. I had given up a lucrative job in a medical college. We had no health benefits. Had I not been breastfeeding our daughter ( which I did for her first year), I don’t know how we would have fed her. I recall one time having only 1$ for food; I spent it on 9th street @ the open air sheds of the Italian Market, allocating fifty cents for 2 different vegetables. I cooked and froze some as purées, freezing them in ice cube trays which were easy to defrost .. As our daughter grew I introduced these into her diet yellow (squash), green ((spinach), carrots (orange), etc . - is it any wonder that she became an artist and loves vegetables?

 My husband learned somewhere about tofu. Tofu was foreign to us. He was Italian, and I, a Wasp.  Soybeans were then under 40 cents a pound and a lb of beans made a great deal of tofu. He bought a paperback: The Joy of Tofu which introduced us to the process of making tofu- soaking the beans overnight, processing them into a milk, adding a coagulant such as Epsom salts or lemon juice, and shaping them into bricks in a wooden settling box. The by-product, Okara, was also used ias an extender ( think hamburger helper) or made into a sausage-like protein. A 1lb brick of tofu was the result of soaking overnight and processing for an hour, which filled the hour our daughter napped. Beans(tofu) and rice were cheap and formed a complete protein.

 We have not been food insecure since then but I still live near the market and I have my settling box.

As a new {3rd? Wave) has been predicted I told my daughter we should stock up on some GMO soybeans, just in case.…

 My parents married in 1933 during an economic depression . My mother was thrifty and organized her meals to recycle creatively into more than one day’s meals for a family of six. This laid the groundwork for my learning thrift and recycling . She was a college graduate and a teacher. She returned to working outside our home only when I was in junior high school. I returned to work when my daughter was 9. Until then I eked out a living with my home skills , sewing gifts for kids’s gifts and our wardrobes, gardening whatever we could grow and eat, learning to hand make my own breads and English muffins ( another good book was “Better Than Store Bought” - who knew you could make your own bagels or ricotta cheese @ home until then? Remember, this was before the Internet gave us instant access to. Everything and phones were still on wire tethers and walls),I made homemade play dough tree ornaments, etc., heated our home with wood and a Franklin stove which I tended while my bread rose on a shelf behind it.

 I think it made us more creative and resourceful. It also made me a committed recycler. It also led to my collecting and hoarding items “ in case” I ever needed them for myself or others, in my desire to not be caught short.

Meanwhile, I plan to fill a jar with soybeans and decorate my kitchen with it Just In Case.

 And I am mindful that When you have your health you have your first million”

I’m quarantined and holding onto my first million as I work my way through the million articles I’ve collected in my past 75 years.

As she was recording it people 50’s and up were congregating without masks and dismissive of. that and covid, stating it was a hoax.  They were approaching her, wanting to hug her and console her.

11,journal-entry-5405,"Well, I'm sorry I didn't post on my normal day. Everything in my ""work room"" was put away for Thanksgiving, so I happily lapsed a bit in all my responsibilities.

 We stayed at home, of course, and zoomed with my parents and sister for the holiday. Drank too much just like usual, felt like crap the next day, like usual. Got into political arguments  like usual. It was honestly a pretty normal Thanksgiving, but of course, still in this same house with the same people.

The sunroom I work in has become unusable for a pretty big portion of the day now due to too much, well, sun coming in. This irritates me much more than it reasonably should, but lots of things are doing that now.

We put up our Christmas decorations the day after Thanksgiving. We were desperate to do something special, something that would make the house look different and more cheerful. It's nice, but I wonder if it will just make the wait for more time off work and school seem longer.

While  I kind of anticipated having some emotional problems  back when lockdowns were first being discussed back in March,  I've mostly been doing OK up to this point. But yesterday  into the very early morning today  is the first time I've felt like I might actually want some help. It's like there's this dark, sunken feeling in my chest, and nothing is interesting, maybe that's not the right way to put it. Nothing is *satisfying,* nothing I do gives me that feeling that you usually get - that it clicks, that it feels correct, that finishing it gives some sense of completion or accomplishment. That feeling you don't ever even notice until you can't feel it.

 I think it's the fact that COVID numbers are shooting up extraordinarily high, and they're almost guaranteed to accelerate even further with this holiday, and the next ones. I just heard that the Supreme Court ruled that religious gatherings couldn't be restricted, just in time for the coldest holidays of the year. It's murderous. And while I hope the Biden administration will improve things, when I think of all the damage, the acceleration of spread that will happen in the meantime, and the fact that he has repeatedly signaled his opposition to M4A, to locking the country down, etc., I truly don't have much faith in his leadership, either. Leaders in both parties are afraid to disappoint business interests, so more innocent people will die because we don't have the courage or the sense to do the only rational thing - pay people to stay home and give generous hazard pay and safety equipment to essential workers.

 On top of the failed leadership, there's the indifference that everyday people have developed. And  what's even worse,  in my opinion,  a performative approach to disease prevention that doesn't actually respect the biological realities of the virus.  ""Bubbles"" whose members associate with other people, masks sagging below the nose, school sports happening at all, and so on.  The individualist focus that Americans have disgusts me. Maybe I'll have more organized thoughts on that subject at another time.

I just can't find much reason to think there's something good on the horizon."

And honestly that’s what’s so deceiving about diet culture. I might appear physically healthy but inside I still experience anxiety and depression. There are days I don’t want to get out of bed. Weeks, actually. I am grief-filled, easily irritable, and unsatisfied with my life. The majority of these issues (and healthier habits too) have come about because of the pandemic. I started watching a lot more wellness and lifestyle videos online and have become inspired to join the movement for intuitive eating. I’ve become inspired to love my body and exercise to show it love. But I’ve also become miserable, torn away from my friends and school life, isolated, and hopeless.

It's very frustrating for me this year to see people who don't understand why we can't gather in big groups. They almost want to do it to be defiant. So many hard working people trying to fight this pandemic and there are others not willing to give up one large holiday gathering.  Be safe and smart people!"
17,journal-entry-5317," A few days ago,  on the first day of Thanksgiving break,  I decided to drive to the airport to watch the planes land and take off. The drive was longer than expected, and once I got to the free parking lot, I couldn't really see much of the airport or tarmac through the grated fence. However, when I was on the highway near the airport, I saw a glimmer in the sky from a plane that had just departed, and that got me really hopeful and excited. I think a plane took off as I was turning in to the parking lot, but I couldn't stop to take a look because I had to make a crazy hairpin turn. I saw 2 planes take off and 2 planes land in total. The cell phone lot is the perfect place to see incoming planes, and the first plane I saw come in was a beautiful blue Southwest Airlines plane. I saw it at a perfect, beautiful profile side angle. I couldn't see the departing planes that well, but I got very excited when their engines revved and when I saw them take off into the sky. It was dusk by the time I left, and the last plane I saw come in looked like a bright, distant star or streetlight as it flew in from a distance. Surprisingly, it was an Amazon prime cargo plane. I didn't expect to see those types of planes come in to Bradley, but with it being the only major airport in the state, I guess it makes sense in hindsight.

 I didn't feel the exact sense of excitement that I was hoping for when going to the airport, as I thought I would feel like I was travelling myself and have the same excitement and energy as if I was going somewhere. However, I still felt good for going to the airport, and  I was really happy and excited whenever the planes came and went. I did have some minor car trouble when leaving though, and it made me realize just how difficult it is to find a place to pull into to check your car out without being on the side of a major road.

 Going to the airport made me want to travel for real and get 100% of the experience and excitement instead of just looking from afar."

I am also a sad daughter seeing my parents worried and angry because the banks won't freeze the loans, even though no monei is really moving in the market. They must be thinking we have a chicken that makes golden eggs, or the tree that Pinocchio wanted to find, that grows gold in its roots. Because wherelse do people find the money to pay loans when the part of the world that doens't include great forces and capitals, is forzen.

 I am a sad friend, who can't speak on the phone anymore, because my head hurts. They tell us (I am sure they are laighung internally saying it), ""When all this is over, you will find out which relationship was worthy to last and which not"".....Come on, government...You became the lady in the gossip magazine with the relationship advice.

 I am a sad and angry citizen, whose rights are being violated and who can't fight the police that beats us in every oportunity.

But I am not angry with corona at all. Corona is not some invisible enemy like the mass media are keep saying. It is a virus, not even a living organism, who caught us by surprise...once again.

3,journal-entry-5267," We actually upped the number of days we subscribe to print news because I am clinging to the news as a place for information that is reliable and factual. We actually get two papers -- the local and the New York Times -- and I toggle between them for local and national/global stories. I also really appreciate our governor (Inslee in WA) and trust him because he is listening to experts and scientists.

 My friends are all over the gamut and feel less objective to me. A lot of what I am experiencing from them (and in my own life too) is so situation dependent, and so I am trying to stay above what they are saying/doing and stick with the higher level recommendations from the state and city officials. So, for example, we cancelled a trip to CA for Thanksgiving because WA, OR and CA issued travel advisories, but we have a (masked, gloved) cleaning person who comes twice a month (and we always wear masks when she is there, or just leave so she can be alone), which is allowed according to the state recommendations.

 My mom watches a ton of CNN and she makes me crazy with all of her secondhand news reports. Everything is a crisis. She teases me that I don't watch TV and therefore don't know how bad it is but I have always preferred newspapers because the news is vetted and the ink has been allowed to dry so it tends to be less sensational. It also reminds me that there is more out there than just COVID and I can digest it at my own pace (sometimes the Sunday paper takes me a week).

 I am so grateful Biden won the election and hope that he is able to thread the needle between keeping the economy open and people healthy, and between the people who trust science and the people who don't seem to. I think having an adult in charge who seems to really want the best for all people is a good place to start and I think I will trust what his administration says about what to do.

One last thing -- when I think about trust, I also think about the vaccines that are being tested, and my trust level on that is low, not because they started under the previous administration but because they were rushed, and that makes me very nervous. I have read articles in which doctors say they will be first in line and others where nurses say they aren't running to get a vaccine until more testing has been done. So on that I am a little relieved I am in the last category of eligible people to receive a vaccine so I can delay the decision. I vaccinate for everything else, but this feels different."

5,journal-entry-5223," COVID-19 shifted the role of an RA from a student leader and community builder to that of a police. At the age of 19 I have been asked to watch and discipline students my age or a year younger than me who are just trying to have a college experience. Adolescents tend to engage in risky behaviours when they feel out of control, and right now that is definetly the case, so I understand where the restlessness comes from, but there's two things.  One, they are being more reckless than we were last year. They are sleeping with each other like crazy,  and normally I'm all for shameless sexuality, but right now? Having relations with multiple partners? With 8? All of which are also having relations with other people, and sharing drugs, and going out to parties? Yeah...that's stressful as all f*** to think about. Second, I am also an adolescent that wants to be stupid sometimes. There have been so many times where I was on the boarder of, ""okay, if we get tested and then go to a party and get tested again hopefully we'll be okay...Everyone else keeps doing it and nothing is happening"". But because I have to be the authority figure I have to lead by example so I can't do anything. At the beginning of the year students complained that they felt they were being watched by the RAs, but we are moreso. If we slip up once we lose our standing in being able to enforce the compact, so I'm constantly looking over my shoulder.

Where there should've been the opportunity to connect, we've only created a rift, and although I do have a few students that I've been able to build relationships with, many of them are simply off limits to me. Especially my residents that are in Greek life who, in a normal year we'd probably get along amazingly, but because of this we can't.

Also because of COVID, almost none of the sophmores are here. I went from having a college friend group to having one close friend and several singular friendships that I sometimes catch up with. I feel alone."
6,journal-entry-5219,"I'm not sure what exactly has changed about the world since coronavirus began. I think we can see very well which countries are strong enough to protect their people in a crisis like this, and that the United States is not one of them. I think the USA's international standing will be affected, and it had already degraded substantially over the past four years. It's hard to predict the repercussions of that, or what that will mean for how long and whether we can build back our international reputation. It feels like the pandemic has been a crisis that revealed many hidden (and not so hidden) weaknesses. We can choose to address those weaknesses or continue to ignore or deny them. It does feel as if our society is at a crossroads, where we have this choice, bit it's unclear what path we'll take. Even if we acknowledge these weaknesses and choose to address them--an important first step that is not guaranteed-- there is of course profound disagreement about how they can be addressed, as there should be in a democratic and diverse society. But since our mechanisms for discourse and sharing factual information are broken as well and are part of the problem, it's unclear how to proceed. I don't know how to get people who are deeply entrenched in conspiracy theories to recognize that they are being conned, at everyone's expense. We know that slave owners after the Civil War continued to deny that they were responsible for wrongdoing, and we know that many people who supported Hitler's rise in Nazi Germany claimed not to know anything about the Holocaust, even as the evidence was in front of them and they actively or passively enabled the genocide. So history shows denial is powerful in situations where fascism, racism, and genocide have gained traction. I don't know how to have dialog with someone who is not coming to the table in good faith, and indeed wants to actively exclude people, including me, from that table."

For him, the pandemic has turned much of his world upside down: he now goes to school every other work via Zoom, has few if any club activities or celebrations like Homecoming, school sporting events. Those he does experience are adapted in one way or another. Last night we viewed his National Honor Society induction ceremony as a Youtube video recording. What would have taken 45 minutes in a large auditorium with applause was a 15-minute video that I and his dad (we're divorced) viewed separately from our homes.

But it hasn't all fallen apart. Fortunately, his summer baseball team was able to have a full season from July through October! They didn't play as many different teams, but he played, with a quietly cheering crowd of parents (socially distanced).

The college process has been ridiculous. Very few colleges offered in-person tours. No recruiters visiting the high school. He took his SATs wearing a mask. Baseball coaches really haven't been recruiting - many have players playing a 5th year due to the spring baseball season cancellation, so the number of spots on teams are very limited. His dream of playing college baseball may not be attainable.

On the plus side, he took on some unique activities that I'm sure wouldn't have happened without this pandemic: 1) helped develop new curbside service at the local apple orchard salesroom he works at, 2) mail-ordered duck eggs and hatched them, 3) visited his grandparents more often.

I worry for him that his senior year will have to be curtailed in many ways to remain safe. Prom? Spring baseball season? All Night Grad party? What will his freshman fall semester at college be like?

All in all, he's thriving. He doesn't complain. I worry about him. I pray for him. I think he'll come through this a stronger and more resilient person. But it's hard to watch."

I think the biggest way I was affected this week is on Tuesday when I had a potential exposure scare. I started to realize how much bigger my social circle is than I believed. It's not just about me getting sick, but my parents and their coworkers, my coworkers and their friends and families, my friends and their family, coworkers and friends. Thankfully the test was negative, but I never had that happen before until 8 months into the pandemic.

The other way it's been affecting me is that I'm hearing about it every. Single. Night. On the news. I understand casing are rising and people shouldn't travel, but it's overwhelming to hear about death, isolation, burnout, and heartbreak every night. I started disliking the news because it's the same thing and that's all we're hearing about, but at the same time, I do want to stay aware and informed. I think I might start watching later and leave for a few minutes just for my own sake."

I started dating a woman about 7 weeks ago and just before we were landed in to Level 5 again (severe lockdown), I asked her to be my girlfriend. At the time, level 5 was a possibility but not a certainty. Anyway even if it was a certainty, I don't think it would have changed my actions, she is a wonderful person. But it has been hard. We are still getting to know each other and want to spend time together. But at the moment, all  restaurants and cafes are closed. Cinemas and museums are closed.  No household visits, indoor or outdoor are allowed.  And its winter!! In rainy Ireland!!  So we picnic in the cold, we walk in the cold, we go to the supermarket together in the hopefully not cold and we get by. But it's hard and there is a great sense of longing for both of us to just do normal things. I dream of the day I will hold her hand  across a restaurant table  or cuddle in close  as we watch a movie on a couch. I suppose it will be ever more the sweeter once it happens."

 My son told me today ""Well, a long time ago they didn't have airplanes. So, they used spaceships instead!"". This just made me laugh and laugh.

I find myself sharing these stories about my children almost exclusively on social media because I cannot even deal with the social and political reality that we are embedded in. I'm someone who used to post daily about social justice and politics. I would say about 90% of my posts pre-covid were about political topics.

1. Social inequality is rampant even though ignored for decades by many whites

2.  White supremacy came out for under the rocks and began mobilizing and threatening violence

3.  The people who make our economy work are front line employees like bus drivers, grocery clerks, nurses, delivery people, ..who are paid the most poorly despite their critical role in keeping the county going

4. Presidential power is unchecked , and we had a president who lied and cheated and used the office for his personal gain When he lost the election in 2020, he refused to concede precipitating a constitutional crisis 

5.  People began growing their own food, as food insecurity was a constant threat.  Food banks doubled their efforts to help poor and unemployed people meet their nutrientional:needs.

6. Schools opened and closed and opened and closed depending on the COVID count.

7.  The highest concentration of cases and deaths were in nursing homes and prisons , where people were in close contact. 

8.  Medical personal were faced with sick people filling up ERs and beds . After months of taking care of hundreds and thousands of patients, they began to burn out and get sick themselves. 

9 The country was divided between those who thought that pandemic was a hoax and refused to wear masks and those who wore masks and tried to obey government recommendations in regard to hand washing, social distancing, gathering outdoors in small groups and not indoors, etc.

It was a pleasant surprise to have someone answer the phone since it normally rings 10 or more times and you must call back when the phone system disconnects the unanswered call. I asked if more residents became infected and how often they tested them for COVID-19. She said no residents, but 2 more staff members tested positive. They are now testing residents multiple times per week. She said 18 residents and 19 staff members were positive.

I received an automated call [...] at 4:27 stating 28 residents and 19 staff members were positive for COVID-19.

 At 6:17 I got a call [...]. I had a sinking feeling that I knew why they were calling. Even though Mom was asymptomatic and had a 98.5-degree temperature, she tested positive on a rapid test and was moved to the COVID wing.  She had been in contact with a staff member who has COVID-19. They will get the PCR lab test results today to confirm the diagnosis. I asked what they were doing for her such as extra vitamins D and C or peroxide in a nebulizer. [M.] didn't know and told me to ask the nurse in the COVID wing.

 I do not understand  why was Mom moved so quickly. If they weren't sure she had the virus and need to wait for the lab results, why didn't they just close the door to her room and let her stay there in isolation? Now that she is in the area with the people who have COVID-19, she will almost certainly get it and die.

Delight in what I do 

Could this be true

Or am I misconstrued? 

Why I can’t look him in the eyes

Without saying goodbye 

To the lies that keep my sighs

Heavy with dread so I

Go to bed thinking 

All has been said 

Until dreaming

Forces some to say they 

Can’t think straight 

While others are used to the

Shake at night where 

Creative words are 

Blown away, at bay 

Kept there by the knight’s rest

Receding resounds resonance

At confessing the unwritten 

Words in my head 

Have a difficult way of getting onto paper.

Three fourths of my life can’t be expressed

In the change that buys my growth 

Of perception conceptualizing. 

Molding skin lamps become the barricade

Plastering layers over light 

Shining through the window paine

Skin is a craft crypted by one's eyes

Transcending perfection’s pain

To be a better you that was the

Yesterday me who believed in

Festering feasible fevers fastly fasting

The fair fairytale. 

Was all a lie

Conceived after a cry

Leaving lines locally linear 

Relenting the hard bearing truths 

Jagged paths scarring the bark tree

Manufactured synthetically effervescently.

 

Painfully know how the 50 states of America

Are grey, black and white dominated

Reinforcing the red White and blue 

Story marionetting the strings of 

Children’s toys.

Half feelings of guilty fulfilled desire

Only to be souled by the completed liar 

Soiled confessions with inner shames that blame 

Those who came to the ‘lame’ events contesting protests

21,journal-entry-5081," Doing a Ph.D. in a pandemic -

It is difficult and frustrating to do a Ph.D.  I cannot meet other students. I cannot attend conferences. To say that at one point, the world is on my fingertip, and yet it is so distant. I can't wait for this to be over. I can't wait for the smell of good coffee and the sound of the crowd in a coffee-shop. I can't wait for face to face discussions. How do we make sense of this lost time? What do we do in the meantime, while we wait for the world to get back to normal. At one point, these concerns are elitist and trivial and at another point, the amount that my time has been wasted in trying to stay on top of things, not lose balance, keep rethinking research questions in a possible pre-covid scenario or a possible post-covid one also seems difficult.

How do I cope with the lost crucial time? How do I make sense of it? Each day, I stare at the computer and lose the time to interact, I lose the time to actually learn. I try to make sense of the non-verbal cues on the internet. And yet, what are the positives of this? I don't know. Is there any positive side to this that I am missing. Access to talks of course. But they are always there on the internet. What do I do with them? But surely, there must be something positive in not traveling, working from home, etc. Maybe that is a post for another day. A day on which I mark myself to be more positive or hopeful for the future.Until then, yes doing a Ph.D in the middle of the pandemic just sucks. Absolutely sucks!"

Our local YMCA permanently closed, where we were taking my son to learn to swim. Lots of local businesses had to close.

I don't know. I don't feel that I have a good answer for this question right now, because I have a ""before"" and a ""during,"" but no ""after."" So much of that ""before-time"" feels almost frozen in amber to me right now, even though I know the landscape will have changed when it's finally safe to resume life again.

We have a housing first model, but try finding housing first landlords.... We are having more issues with hotels and clients in hotels. More clients are presenting with more severe mental illness.

Beyond being irritated, I have found some joy in my volunteer work. I have purpose. I am working on a certificate in Trauma Interventions and Prevention. I am looking forward to an internship this summer.

 The magnificent colors of fall have disappeared. We are entering the palette of winter:  varying shades of brown, black and white. The early darkness saps my energy. I saw an article on reading for mental health during the pandemic. Yes, that is one coping skill I use on a regular basis.

I am still in amazement at how many reality-deniers are out there. People whose minds won't change, even while they are dying from COVID! COVID is no joke!

Election fever has rapidly taken over the news. People are more worried than ever before about who is President of the United States. Trump loyalists tout rumors of election fraud and refuse to concede. Democrats are announcing policies like open borders and vaccines for all.What will happen depends on who leads us. And the pandemic rages on beneath it all. Some things never change.

The next big thing on the calendar is Thanksgiving. I always look forward to the church services, family gatherings and greetings. This year, not so much.

5,journal-entry-4992," Back in March of 2020, I came home to Dubai for the start of what we did not realize would be this ongoing pandemic. What I think people in countries like the UK and the US did not realize was how strict the lockdown and restrictions were here in the UAE, and other countries in this region compared to theirs. Something I noticed was that in countries with the strictest lockdowns, (of course strict governments) there was little to no complaining, and then as you move towards lighter lockdowns and less strict governments, the amount of complaining, rioting and fight back increased. The UAE locked us down essentially from March until June so almost a full 4 months. And this varied from half a week where not one single person was allowed to leave their homes while the city was being disinfected to weeks on end without being allowed outside of our homes. People would then argue, ""Oh but you're in Dubai it's like you're on holiday"", but also something people did not realize is that this summer we had record-breaking temperatures reaching up to 52 degrees celsius meaning being outside for more than 15 minutes was too much to do. It was just a strange feeling because I would wake up in the morning, go about my day with online school and the things that I had to do but it got to the point that I would wake up so many mornings like this that I forgot what it was like to be outside. I felt as though we were participating in an experiment or as if life was like a movie and was not progressing day by day. It felt like the world had paused but we were in this house day in and out doing the same thing over and over. Also the days would fly by weirdly enough so I would wake up early to maintain a routine and get about my day and the next thing I knew I was getting into bed that night.

Apart from missing my cousins so much who live in the same area as me, literally a 3 minute walk from me, who I did not see for more than 2 months, I realized how much I missed walking. The day that the restrictions were lifted, I think I went out for a one and a half hour walk and now I have to make sure I walk a bit at least once a day or move my body or I just don't feel good. Personally, there are so many positive things that came out of this experience and things that we learned to appreciate again, even such basic things like walking.

Something I was inspired by was the Front Step's project, which was American photographers going to people's front doors and doing a socially distanced photoshoot.  The point of the project was to show people at their doors, reminding everyone that even though our doors are closed and we are home we are all there in the same boat as one another and we are closer to each other in distance than it feels like.I decided to create my own version based in Dubai through an instagram page. Because of privacy and strict restrictions I chose to make the portraits digitally drawn based off of photos I had been sent but this was something that kept me busy, and I hope brought about the same feeling of those people being photographed in America to the people for whom I did portraits of."

 I have felt so lucky that myself and close family have not contracted covid, however, another health issue has been silently taking over my life. I have struggled with depression and anxiety before the pandemic, but as the pandemic continues to take hold of our lives it has continued to worsen. Mental health has regularly been swept under the rug and ignored but in my experience, this awareness has been even more minimal. The anxiety, fatigue, sadness, and the constant weight of uncertainty has been overwhelming. The awareness is minimal and the outreach is simply just ""its okay to feel this way"". But where are the actual resources?? Out of five professors, only one offered potential extensions on assignments and shorten research papers. The usual research paper for the final assignment is 30 pages in length, given what is going on she shortened it to 15 pages. In my other two classes, the professors have kept the 35-page length of the research papers. I struggle with this because I do not want my education to suffer due to the pandemic. I am paying full-price for my classes still and  I love what I am learning. But on the other hand, how am I supposed to put out good quality academic work while this is going on? I am struggling with my mental health. I do not admit this often and hate to say it when so many are dying from covid. but maybe admitting it is the best step forward."
10,journal-entry-5018," I think that it will take a long time for the world to go back to normal and I am not sure if it ever will. I think that people will become much more cautious of their symptoms and perhaps start wearing masks whenever they feel sick.  Mask wearing is common in other cultures already, so it could also become common in American culture. I also think that it will take a long time for gatherings of large groups of people to occur. Events, such as concerts, will be postponed for years. People also have developed anxiety around large crowds due to the pandemic, so it will take a while for everyone to feel comfortable putting themselves in a big group of people again. The pandemic has introduced to us a new virtual world that we are now consumed in. We now use technology to communicate, learn, meet with others, and so much more. Although technology has always been a big part of our world, we have become dependent on it. Learning has now become completely virtualized, will younger students be able to transition to in person learning if they have only experienced online learning? We shall see. I also am concerned for the future of the arts. As a dancer who is majoring in dance, I am worried with how the arts will be able to survive through this pandemic. With Broadway closed until May and dance studios all over the country being forced to close due to loss of income, the dance industry and the arts overall is struggling. Performances are cancelled and it is uncertain when performances will be able to take place. Performances bring in money and without them the arts are not receiving the funding they need. I hope that once the pandemic is over, the arts can be celebrated in the way it deserves to be."

Life was precarious there so I also learned to rely on my neighbors and community. During that time I felt connected to larger processes of the world and nature-- lived through a hurricane among other things, and recognized how little we can control.

Por ejemplo, en mi caso, las verduras del mercado nos las siguen llevando a la casa. Si vamos al mercado, entramos muy rápido, compramos y volvemos a salir, todo de forma muy rápida. Solamente salimos de casa si es necesario. Tratamos de no salir.

Como somos el tercer país al que más afecta el cambio climático, en este momento una tormenta tropical arrasó con todo en varios departamentos del país. Eso nos tiene entretenidos. Como el gobierno no ayuda para nada, la población provee de donaciones de alimentos, ropa, kits de limpieza, etc.

Creo que lo que ha cambiado en el mundo es que la mayoría de personas han sentido en carne propia los efectos del cambio climático. El COVID-19 es una consecuencia del cambio climático.

A lot of my co-workers are testing positive for the virus as we are a grocery store and see quite a diverse group of people every day.  This happening is creating opportunities for me to work more as people have to be out for sick leave when they are suspected of coming in contact with the virus. As working for me is an incredible pass time for me benefits myself, but the thoughts of co-workers being out of works for weeks is terrible in its own right.

Es raro estar cerca de la tercera edad y tener que mudarte al lugar donde fuiste joven, casi niña. Por momentos, lo siento como un retroceso. Como me quedé con una capacidad respiratoria limitada (no puedo subir gradas sin agitarme mucho) me he quedado aquí, porque la casa es de un solo piso. Eso me ha hecho pensar que cuando uno es mayor debería tener una casa de un solo piso. Uno cree que siempre va a tener la capacidad de subir unas cuantas gradas y no, esa capacidad se puede perder.

Además, solo tengo las cosas indispensables conmigo. La mayoría de mis cosas se quedaron en la casa de mi hijo. Entonces, también me doy cuenta de lo fácil que es vivir con poco. A veces uno cree que necesita muchas cosas, pero no, con unas cuantas la vida continúa y no pasa nada, allí estás, respirando, viviendo.

Our children are not free to learn and play as they where before pandemic.

Our children are more anxious, because we as parents are anxious as well.

We are not able to obtain goods in order to meet our basic necessities.

On the other hand, I feel strongly that life can not stop due to the pandemic. Every of us should learn to take care not only of himself but also for others.Everyone should learn express openly, thoughts, feelings and encourage our family, friends, etc to express their fears.We must find ways to communicate and respect each other.We should enhance solidarity and at least pray and wish for everyone to have every prosperity and health.

 Every day, this pandemic teaches me a lot of lessons about valuable human ethic values and the importance of solidarity and love.

 I wish everyone good luck and every prosperity.

Best regards.

24,journal-entry-4924,This week I finally got a call from my neurologist and told me I can finally start my rehab treatment for my disability in December. I’ve waited 9 months for this to happen. As cases are increasing drastically in my area I’m worried that my treatment will have to get postponed. I also was notified I needed to completely quarantine to be extra cautious so I can start the treatment. I used to be able to go pick up essentials but now I have to rely on my parents and siblings to pick up stuff for me. I have so many mixed emotions. With starting the treatment I will also be exposed to more people as this is being done in a big hospital in my area. This also scares me. I just don’t know how to feel I go from anxious to excited it’sa whole rollercoaster. I’m scared.
25,journal-entry-4878," Numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are rising, and this is very sobering. Living in a more rural area has allowed me to walk with friends, to visit outdoors with friends, and this week to attend an outdoor service at our church.The gift of wonderful fall days has allowed me the outdoor and friend activities that feel closer to normal, and each has felt like a gift.

 Thinking ahead to the holidays is also sobering; longing to be with family is real. On the other hand, we recognize the importance of erring on the side of caution and will Zoom with our children on Thanksgiving. Then we'll look ahead to Christmas and decide what's best. Sigh..."
1,journal-entry-4893," I didn’t get to have the Dump Trump party I envisioned!! But in all seriousness - Can I get a Heck Yeah!!!!! This past week was all about the election. I have friends say to me (my Philly friends ❤️) that they felt connected to more people, everyone was celebrating and then today - a couple of days later - they are feeling more isolated and deflated again. I told my friend that because I have come into COVID as a generalized anxiety girl that I am doing better right now. I read that somewhere - that people with history of depression and those that live with anxiety are better prepared because we aren’t shocked when things don’t go as expected. Of course COVID is no one’s normal level of anxiety but I do feel that I am more cautious in general (not so much that it stops me from doing hard things or enjoying my life) but I am more adjusted to this because I am already always worried about something. Maybe now people will have more respect for those of us with anxiety! Also - our schools are starting to have more cases. There was talk a few weeks ago that they wanted everyone back in. Well - that can’t happen now. We are happy and grateful to stay all virtual."
2,journal-entry-4897,"Corona virus has affected me in a lot of ways especially in terms of mental health. This week, my grandfather died and due to the pandemic, there have been less planes regularly shuttling back and forth between usual places. So, I had to wait for a plane that went from Albany, New York to Richmond, Virginia. Due to this, on the last and connecting flight to Richmond my grandfather died, and I couldn't say goodbye. I experienced his loss through a text when I landed and proceeded to cry into my hands. I couldn't talk or move but eventually had to because the plane had to continue on it's way.  The pandemic made me miss the final goodbye to my grandfather."
3,journal-entry-4890," It made me very happy that Joe Biden won the presidency. Previously I had never been a fan of his, but I do feel that his prior experience, personal style, and caring demeanor will go far to hep us heal the ravages of Trump. I just am very upset by the many who did votes for him. What can they possibly see in him? I can’t fathom how one could condone his selfishness, willful deceit and constant lying. I feel that he is not stable mentally and is now potentially dangerous in his last two months. Let’s hope that our checks and balances can prevent a war declaration or something wicked. His rhetoric has been vindictive and so unwise in so many decisions over the last four years. Even his face registers hate and contempt for the foundations of our country and the workings of government. He makes a mockery of democracy. It’s such a shame that the transfer of power could not be peaceful and graceful as it has been even in cases of bitter rivalry. Trump is no gentleman and no man of honor. His legacy will be a sad one because of his own bungling. Biden’s inauguration can’t come soon enough."

I had a tightness in my chest and really bad allergies, and my anxiety made me worried, so I got a saliva test. Flash forward a few days and I got a positive result, after having stayed with my boyfriend and his family for the weekend. This through me into a panic, my mom into a panic, and everyone I had seen, despite precautions we had taken. I had a few breakdowns, absolutely unconsolable, and thought I was going to accidentally kill someone in my life because of possible COVID exposure. Two days later I got another test, and the results came back the next day as negative. Everyone around me had tested negative as well, but I know that there is only a 0.02% of a false positive, so I am currently in limbo trying to figure out if I actually tested positive or if it was a false positive.

My mom is over 60, and so is her boyfriend, and I tutor a few times a week. I take every precaution under the sun besides staying inside and not leaving my house. My dad on the other hand thinks COVID is a hoax to incite fear. He goes to church with 40+ people, doesn't wear a mask, and refuses to get tested. I don't live with him. My brother goes back and forth living with my mom and my dad, but for some reason he doesn't think COVID is as bad as it is. He takes precautions, but doesn't see the problem in my dad not taking them.

My mom now works from home all the time, same with her boyfriend. I do school online, driving up once a week for a class we have outside. I tutor twice a week, mask on always. My boyfriend works remotely, his sister goes to high school, his mom and dad work and take all precautions.

8,journal-entry-4885," The pandemic and the results of the presidential election were a weird combination.

 My roommates and I stayed up until 3am every night last week watching the election results. For no reason, mostly. We knew that the results wouldn't come in on Tuesday, but we watched anyway. We hoped for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, even though the news said it was unlikely. On Saturday morning, I was laying in my bed when I heard someone yelling outside. I knew then it happened We all got up and got dressed and bought champagne and went to McCarren park.

 It was like half of Brooklyn was there. There was a live band, the streets were packed, people were cheering and popping bottles left and right. Honestly, it was so refreshing to see so many people out together. So many people smiling and cheering and laughing. I forgot about the pandemic.

It turned into a daylong celebration, we went to manhattan, we came back to Brooklyn. We walked to a bridge at midnight and back.

And then on Sunday, we agreed to get covid tests, because while it felt for a while like the world was ""normal"" again, it wasn't. So we're all waiting on our results now, and we've settled back into our usual routine. My cousins are talking about 25M fraudulent votes on social media (I have no clue where they got that number), but I'm just praying I didn't trade a day of celebration for illness."

Staying up late for a long period makes me feel difficult to pay attention to studies and feel tired more frequently than before.

10,journal-entry-4776," For the first time since the pandemic began, my husband and I elected to go to a local beer/wine bar  as we wanted  to celebrate the election of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States. Prior to March, this had been a weekly outing for us, but we had been playing it safe by not frequenting restaurants or bars. I was still a bit worried about our decision, but we wore masks when we ordered our drinks and then settled ourselves at a table far from any other patrons. (As we had chosen to go at 4 p.m., only two other revelers were inside the building at the time.) We had a good time, and it made my heart happy to venture out after so many months of quarantining."

Mis compañeros, algunos vienen de la ciudad vecina y unos ya fueron positivos de covid19, así y todo se rehúsan a llevar correctamente el barbijo o lavarse las manos. Por lo que dijeron sus síntomas fueron leves y ni lo sintieron, no quiero sonar maliciosa pero supongo que sí tal vez gente como ellos se enferman, deberían enfermarse con una carga realmente fuerte del virus y tal vez así serían más respetuosos con los que aún no enfermaron.

I wonder how much of an effect it will have. I still feel pessimistic about what's happening on the university campus but there is absolutely no discussion about moving to online. I don't know how much students will be controlled in their apartments as far as social gatherings go, especially since we're outside of Paris proper...so I'm skeptical that we'll see numbers going down drastically as a result of these new measures.

18,journal-entry-4759," 7 November 2020. COVID-19 infections rise to over 100,000/day this week. Some hopeful news from ferret studies (well only six ferrets, divided into 2 sets, two with the spray and one without in two cages) at Columbia University: a nasal spray containing a lipopeptide that matches amino acids in the spike protein which seems to have protected the ferrets given the spray, while the other two got sick. A non-toxic, stable, nasal spray that is effective would be wonderful.

 SUNSHINE: Biden has won the Presidency, horns are honking, and messages are congratulating from around the world -- Brazil, Israel, places with their parallel politics. It is bright and warm outside this fall day. Much work still to be done: the two run-off senate races in Georgia will determine whether Democrats can control the Senate. The good news includes that 130 black women ran for Congress in this cycle, and ninety percent of black women voted for Biden. Also six native American Indians are elected to Congress and many others down ticket. There is now the first Native American superpac, ""Seven Generations"", named for the motif in American Indian thought of caring for the world seven generations ahead.

 Re. COVID-19, it is reported that 376 of the counties across the U.S. with currently the highest rates of infection voted for Trump -- whether they will make the connection between denying the need for social distancing and mask wearing and their infections is unclear (one thinks of the classic Festinger et al., When Prophecy Fails). People like their beliefs, and their anti-heroes. One can only hope that we can figure out how to deflate the folk-hero trappings of Trump, and stifle that virus  before it propagates any further.

CONSTRAINT. Meanwhile life with COVID teeters between a delicate normalcy and constraint. We had dinner this week with a good friend in her late seventies (no longer so old), recently widowed, living alone, and one symptom is extreme fear of infection. She invited us to her apartment, inside, noting that while we were not the first to accept such an invitation, other couples had turned her down on grounds that they were trying to be hyper-cautious (in part she speculates due to worries of their grown kids who bombard them with worries about their safety). We wore masks inside except to eat and drink, were not allowed in the kitchen, stayed six feet apart, sat at the far ends of a long table, set dishes down to be retrieved by the other party rather than passing directly. As she pointed out, being alone without a companion, means she needs to be extra cautious as there is no one to provide help in the first instance. Not that she does not have many friends who check in on her. One of her single friends with whom she speaks ever three or so days, who is immunocompromised from cancer therapy, has it even more fraught, and is dependent on food deliveries which often come with items she has not ordered (because they did not have what she ordered and substituted a different brand or similar item, without knowing if it contained something she could not have). BUT of course, we all agree, we are the lucky ones, roofs over our heads, good food, health care, etc."
19,journal-entry-4714,"My birthday was this past week. While COVID obviously changed some things (I didn't go out with friends), birthdays have always been a super family-centered thing in my family.

I don't live with my family anymore, but  I traveled home to spend the day with them (and stayed to vote with them).My mom's parents were never big on birthdays when she was little. They forgot a lot of them. So she promised herself that when she had kids, she'd make it the best day of the year for them. And she succeeded.

I looked forward to my birthday more than any holiday. She would wake us up with cake and singing and then we'd get to eat cake for breakfast and open presents right there first thing in the morning. And for the rest of the day it was all about you. She'd decorate the whole kitchen as a theme, a couple of times it was spongebob, or movies, or underwater, or disco. It was awesome. Now a days since my brother and I are older, it's just ""birthday"", but she still goes all out. Covers the windows in banners and hangs streamers and tapes decorations to the ceilings, confetti everywhere. It's really sweet.

So in the past week, I feel super grateful not just for her and her continuous effort, but also for being able to spend my birthday with my family. And then to vote as a family. We waited in line for almost 2 hours (we've never waited before) but it was so worth it."
20,journal-entry-4725,"Even though I am from the UK, this week feels like the last few days were sucked into a void due to the US election. Four years ago on the Trump vs Hillary election, I woke up at 4am and at that point the news was suggesting Trump might pull ahead and then the notification came through that he had definitively won at about 5.30-6am British Standard Time. On Wednesday night I suppose I subconsciously feared the same would happen so woke up at 4am again. For a while I lay there and just stroked the cat who lives in the house I rent a room in, who had come and curled up against my stomach when she felt me woke up, too nervous to check my phone. Eventually when I did both Trump and Biden had between 100-200 points each with Biden in the lead. Biden pulled ahead quite a lot and was 100 points ahead about 4.30-5am but then Trump won Texas and accelerated 100 points by the next time I woke up, sleeping ten minute increments at a time. About 7.30am it stabilised at around Biden 224 vs Trump 213 and stayed like that for most of Wednesday - every time I checked BBC news compulsively it would be the same. My landlords are originally American from New Jersey and Illinois and they stayed up all night watching the election results and sleeping on the couch on and off. The day felt like a trance due to sleep deprivation and the distraction of checking the results constantly. In my class the lecturer asked if people had been keeping an eye on the election and others answered yes and kind of laughed about how it was stressful and so annoying to not have an answer yet and in general the embarrassing behaviours of Trump. I couldn’t say anything because tears kept welling up in my eyes thinking about how people can kind of roll their eyes and chuckle about something that has the potential to devastate someone else’s life. I kept thinking about my American friend who had undocumented parents (documented now) and what it means to her to sit and watch the results knowing so many people voted in ways that they likely know could hurt so many others and symbolise no care for their existence or quality of life. Last election when Trump won even though I was only just 18 and not very knowledgeable about American politics when the announcement came out that he had won I couldn’t sleep and didn’t know what to do. Eventually I went and had a shower and stood under the water for ages and just wept and wept until it felt like I was dissolving. I’ve seen lots of women say they did this too because they just knew what was going to come once he was in control. That day I had an introduction to gender studies class and our professor who was from Minnesota originally barely said anything the whole lesson, making us watch lots of videos instead of debating etc. The whole semester we had been talking about the gender of the presidential debates so I think people were expecting her to rage about it but all she ended up doing was that at the end of the lecture after the other videos she said ‘lastly someone has something to say’ and played the video of Hillary Clinton’s ‘women’s rights are human rights’ speech from the 90s. To sit in a class nearly entirely full of women / non binary people / gay men and watch it I had to hold in sobs so hard and looking around I’m sure a lot of others were too, including the professor. This election felt really raw with the memory of last time."
21,journal-entry-4680," The only thing that has prepared me for a time like this is my age - the perspective. The pandemic has invited me to step back and ponder what is really important. I realize the importance of family, friends, faith and connectedness; I'm willing to follow pandemic protocol to protect those who are important to me. I brighten my days by reaching out to others in hopes of brightening their day. I stay active in order to be as physically and mentally strong as possible. Pandemic fatigue is real, but I will make it through."
22,journal-entry-4685," Today I am unable to escape anxiety over the election. I am totally disgusted with the population of the United States who seems to okay a president who is an insane, egotistical, liar. Right now, a day after the election we are told that the count could go on for days. This is so wrong in a day when “Tweets”can travel the world in seconds. Everything is wrong with the USA today, from my point of view. I’m afraid that I might be accused of being old fashioned or out of date when I expect our leadership to be caring, literate, dignified, honest and respectful of all of those he leads. The POTUS has none of those qualifications.

Because I have time on my hands, I’ve followed this election very closely and read everything available about the candidates. I have been dedicated by watching a variety of different news media. Not once did the POTUS put out any real description of his plans for the future. He seems to be totally driven by money,yet he does not put forth any idea how he might get the economy going again. Biden has put forth real ideas about the pandemic, healthcare, opening schools, the economy, our leadership in the world organizations and his goals for addressing climate change. I’m afraid that large segments of the population believe the lies spread during the campaign and by biased news media. It seems that nobody has heard the message that the pandemic must be controlled in order to maximize economic growth. This can be done with simple means, masks, distancing and washing.

I really wanted a Biden sweep. As it is, if he does win, he will have huge challenges in congress. I find this all so sad for our country and fear for our democracy. I won’t give up hope until all the votes are in and a winner is declared. Hopefully trouble won’t ensue."
23,journal-entry-4683,"I don't honestly know. The only thing I can say is that I continue to fall back on my experiences growing up and the people in my life who taught me how to be in the world. We didn't always have a lot, but we had our love for each other, and the willingness to roll up our sleeves, and pitch in and do what it took to contribute to keep things going. I remind myself of all of their guidance and life lessons and I keep coming up with reminders of some key philosophies:

- the importance of listening to others and doing what I can to help, even if it might seem small.

- The importance of just taking each day as it comes and to do my best (sometimes that might be just to get through the day).

- And reminding myself that this isn't going to last forever and to keep my faith and hope in what's good and to try to stay positive and encouraging.

- Gratitude - It's been very important to me to every day think of what/who I'm grateful for  (family, friends, good health, a roof over my head, food on the table) and to share what I have with others.

 I find comfort and strength in those ideas and thinking about my loved ones and what they would do."
24,journal-entry-4688,"For this weeks journal entry, I wanted to focus on a certain event that occurred over the weekend. I attend Skidmore college as a junior. I feel extremely lucky to be able to attend college this year, especially due to what is happening with COVID-19. However,  this weekend, on October 31st, a large group of freshman congregated in a public space on campus, and had a Halloween party. There was NO social distancing, and masks were not being worn properly. Two Asian students attempted to break up the party, as It was violating an immense amount of rules. Instead of dispersing, one freshman got aggressive, and shoved one of the students to the ground. She ended up having to go to the hospital.  This act of violence, as well as having a completely unsanctioned party during COVID, is disgusting. It makes me embarrassed to attend school here. We all signed a pledge to make sure we could continue our educations during this unprecedented time. Instead, some think that partying is more important. So important, that a fellow student doing the right thing ended up in the hospital.

These events, along with the election, have caused me to have severe stress and anxiety.  I fear for our countries future, and I am disgusted with how some people are treating COVID, and fellow students attempting to do the right thing. This has probably been one of the hardest weeks at school during this pandemic.  To anyone reading this, I hope you stay strong, and remain healthy."

1,journal-entry-4694,"   This week, I am going to write briefly about different days.  

   

    Thursday 10/29/20 - Went to my office to meet virtually with clients.  It was the first time since March that I worked from my office.  It felt good to be there.  I wore a dress, rather my typical pandemic work attire of jeans and a nice shirt.  

     Friday 10/30/20 - The weather was terrible - wet snow all day.  It was beautiful to watch from my window, but really created a trapped feeling.  We can't gather indoors, and with this type of weather, we can't gather outdoors either.  

     Saturday - Halloween!  Trick or treating was very different this year.  Fortunately, enough of the snow had melted that kids could go out in costumes, masked and in costume, with masked parents.  Our city had directed us to leave candy out for kids to minimize contact.  Our neighborhood did this in great style - lots of light up decorations and tables left out with candy.  I was disappointed to not interact with all of the costumed kids, but glad to respect safety measures.  

     Sunday - Felt sad and anxious.  My husband's birthday is on 11/10.  In trying to organize a small outdoor gathering to celebrate his birthday.  My son announced that he and his girlfriend, who live in NH, have decided that they can't come down due to concern about exposure and/or exposing us.  I completely understand, but my stomach really sank.  I can't imagine what this holiday season will look like if we can't be together - but need to prepare for this.  

     Monday:  The number of cases in MA are going up significantly, from the low hundreds to low thousands, with increasing deaths and hospitalizations.  Our governor, Charlie Baker, announced a curfew and closings of some businesses, starting this Friday.  It is essential to do this, but I really don't like this new direction.  

     Also - election Tuesday - ANXIETY!

2,journal-entry-4693,"Luckily, I was able to acquire financial assistance from my state in the form of Pandemic Insurance through the department of unemployment benefits. Thankfully I do not have any children to provide for, but I did help my family around the house, namely my mother, by purchasing things they needed and providing some financial relief. I would not like to go into specifics of where or how the money was used within the household, yet I am very grateful for the financial assistance. Work was hard to come by, and having this source of income was very beneficial. However, I am excited to get back into the workforce once the pandemic has come and gone, and earn money the way I've always known how: hard work."
3,journal-entry-4692,"This week is election week, and we all know that the nation views this as something that is monumentally important, quite possibly the most important election in history. The pandemic has not caused the United States to act in a sort of way where they would lose sight of that fact. For that reason, the pandemic has not really affected me as much as previous weeks. I was still able to vote while keeping safety regulations in mind and going about my day the same way I would any other day. The election is at the forefront of everybody's mind, which has momentarily replaced the stress of the pandemic as well. There is still stress, yet it feels good to feel alleviated of a worldwide burden, and focus on something that is so important to our nation and the world."

I (sometimes) hope that you don’t read what I write, 

All of the words I think I fail to tell you in person 

But can somehow manage to write on the paper

That has now become a screen of bright light always challenging 

Me to write more and continue forward as the beacon of 

Emotions a realm of its own for me to feel less shame 

And guilt for having anger, pain and sadness. 

For we live in a world where we thrive off of shadow’s pain 

As a drug to survive and stay illicitly positive 

Even though are not…

The words are just lines articulated and speculated at in a way that 

Makes sense to people. 

Language can be written, learned from seen in the vibrations of sound

A curvy wave of a line that dances to melody of spoken word 

Sung out in a way that can be unrecognizable and yet desired 

To have more music making more memories masquerading 

That art is a form of line that can be interpreted by the body 

Creating shapes like letters similar to the wind blows the leaves 

In a circle cascading leaves in a mini tornado 

We read the lines, deep in them with meanings that aren't written

But felt; a soul wave of connection empathetically taking over me 

I can’t stop creating new ways to think and feel 

Because it’s all already been said or done before but rather 

Interpreted differently,

As though my life is a remake of scattered clips n collections of 

Thousands of lives before me making me my own version 

My own line that I can drug myself into 

Intoxicated with the realm of emotions 

Felt day in and day out. 

Fueled by emotions and a minimal amount of coffee i take off 

Into the transparent screen of bright colors illuminating my mind 

Into a world of that feeds my imaginations creativity surpassing it at times 

To have bursts of information continuing to digest in my mind

As the art forms take me on an emotional rollercoaster of cinema 

That helps me to learn, relax and live life inside of the black rectangle. 

I can log in everyday to my life and I don’t have to see people as much anymore 

My life is now contingent upon the waves of emotions i feel, spurts of energy that I used to be able to hold onto longer but now I struggle to maintain face and composure.

I edit some of the raw parts of myself out, suturing sewing seams into myself to make the scars within me look a bit more presentable

Nowadays that’s the popular thing to do, clean up the scars and present yourself to the world.

It will get harder not easier but in time we can all sip lemonade and feel less scared about ourselves and the rest of the world. "
5,journal-entry-4702,"I feel like I've been tense the past 2 days because of the election. It's like my whole body has its 'fingers' crossed, and I just really hope Biden wins. A few days before the election, I had so much energy and I was ready to make a sign, go out to the streets and start protesting for a peaceful transfer of power. However, as the election draws to a close and the race is much tighter than I expected, I feel like I have to wait until Nevada is called to even begin making my sign, and my energy has kind of dissipated as well.

I have hope that I'll have a spark again if Biden pulls through, and that I'll be able to start advocating against the president's desperate power grab and efforts to bypass the democratic process. Our democracy is what's really at stake if he tries to sidestep our system to stay in power."

However, I have been somewhat at peace the past few days, and am trying to practice self care and remind myself that whatever happens this truth is always the same: I can have faith that God is working all things for good. I truly do believe that, and although I would feel an extreme level of distain if Trump does win ( yes I am an evangelical Christian and NO I am did not vote for Trump), I ultimately hope that our nation can stay united. All I can do is pray that God sends revival, that we become a nation that loves and accepts ALL, that we rid ourselves of the  superiority and nationalistic pride that wrecks the lives of so many, and  HUMBLE OURSELVES so that we may heal from hundreds of years of racial division and inequality."
8,journal-entry-4653," I bought a car, which usually would be a very exciting thing but because of the pandemic it has been very stressful.I don’t currently have a car, which makes getting to car dealerships difficult - many public transportation options are limited and take too long, especially when I only have maybe a day here and there to go test drive a car, which means Uber for every. Single. Trip. Especially when every exposure to another person could mean I’m SOL. In addition, it seems like a lot of cars have been getting more expensive as the pandemic goes on, which is a challenge because my finances have gotten more challenging as the pandemic progresses. But I finally did it! I thought it would just take the morning but it took the whole day and I had to call in an emergency day off at work, but it’s finally done and I don’t have to stress about it any more. And I love my new car!! I took it to the COVID testing clinic I’ve been working at on Saturdays, and my transit time was cut by 70%! Because I didn’t have a car before this, it meant going essentially nowhere outside of walking distance during the pandemic, as I’ve been trying to avoid public transit. But now I can go anywhere, anywhere I want! I think having that freedom is worth the stress it took to get here. I’m hoping to take it for another drive next weekend.

 I’ve been stressed about the election tonight. I’ve been trying to cut down on my alcohol consumption but tonight I got myself some wine to calm down and I’m just going to try to pretend it will all be okay. If Biden doesn’t win, I honestly don’t know what to do. Trump treats the pandemic like nothing,which is absolutely infuriating as a scientist who understands disease transmission, because if he stepped back and did nothing, let states dictate public health individually, we might be in a better position than where we are now all of his misinformation and anti-masking. So many people are tired and he’s done nothing to encourage people to continue being careful - if he is not removed from office I’m worried the damage he’s caused won’t ever heal. I don’t know if I can handle the level of divisive rhetoric of the last four years any longer. I’ve lost friends and family due to this President. But to be honest, Trump didn’t do much more than encourage and expose how half of America really thinks. All I can say is that Dr Anthony Fauci is my hero. I wish Fauci only the best. Please let tonight go according to the polls and let us turn a new page and have an actual leader for the country again."

10,journal-entry-4624,"In this week’s pandemic journal reflection, I wrote about the impact of the pandemic on this year’s election. To be specific, mail in voting. This unprecedented way of voting is bringing doubts, and questioning the integrity of the election. Hence, the current president, Donald Trump, is willing and able to inspire violence over the election result.

This is frightening, and anxious, because the last thing we want during this pandemic is political violence. Trump is a president who encourages violence over peace, division over unity. Without a doubt, he justified his presidential actions as patriotic. According to CBS Evening News, Cities across U.S. bracing for possible Election Day violence and unrest. As a result, businesses are taking extra precautions to protect their business if there is any looting and vandalism.

11,journal-entry-4544," Almost every time I ask someone how they're doing, the response I get is a ""aha"" followed by a sarcastic ""I'm good"" or ""I'm chillin"" or if they're really down, ""I'm doing alright.""

 It feels like everyone, for one reason or another, is going through so much right now, and we don't really know how to deal with it anymore. For me this week especially,  I've been confronted with a moral conflict. My job as an RA started to get easier, but that was  only because I started to let things slide that I knew I shouldn't. I'm caught in this position where, I could choose to enforce the COVID guidelines, risk being isolated from non-RA students and get looks of contempt from people that are just trying to have a some semblance of a college experience. Or, I could choose to let things slide, be a ""homie"" and risk putting my job or people's health on the line.

But no one's been getting sick. And they're pushing the boundaries so hard. Just this week I heard there were at least 3 parties going on for Halloween, and I bet there's probably more. But because they're pushing so hard, and no one's getting sick, I start to wonder if I'm being too harsh. It's my job to report when I see COVID guideline regulations, but the minute I do that I turn into a police. Instead,  I had decided to start letting things slide, and as soon as I did I was allowed to be a student again. I started having genuine interactions with the students and I was able to build community.

 But then I was reminded that, these students aren't just interacting with each other. Now, I've heard a lot of people say ""I don't really care if I get COVID, I just don't want to give it to my [parents/loved ones]"" and because those people aren't here, we can ""do whatever we want' at our own risk. But  my teacher reminded me of the handful of staff members that the students come into contact with (professors, staff, etc.) that do have to go home to their loved ones and are scared. I personally don't have any in-person classes, but a lot of the freshmen have at least one if not more. Not only that, but I personally was reminded just how deadly this virus can be, and I'm scared that if we keep letting things slide it could end really bad. Every time I start to let things slide for my own mental well being I am reminded I can't, or I shouldn't. And I'm lost.

I'm 19 years old. But the job of keeping the campus safe has fallen on our shoulders. I've become a parent, a policeman, and everything but a sophmore. The best part is, this is just one job I have. I'm still a person, a student, I still have a job outside of my university. I run clubs and orgs. I'm trying to get good grades in my classes. Almost none of my friends are here and I don't have my family either. I am alone, and I don't have the power it make it any better for myself.

 So when I say ""aha, yeah I doing great,"" it's cause this sucks. And as much as I have my ups and downs, when it gets bad it just keeps getting worse. But we can't really do much about it.

 I'm sorry that this couldn't be more positive. I hope you, whoever you are, have a good Halloween."

However, this time around, the US is doing terrible when it comes to solving COVID-- it just keeps getting worse and worse. Instead of looking up to the United States people around the world feel sorry for us and look at our government in absolute horror. It's embarrassing and I'm horrified myself."
14,journal-entry-4567,"In this past week, there were increased protocols at work to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We are now to wear masks at all times when in the building. In addition, we are encouraged to work from home as much as possible and avoid coming in. Unfortunately, my program does not have the necessary equipment to do so. We would need printers and fax capability from home. We have been issued laptops and scanners, but that is all we have. In addition, our work is based on actual paper files that cannot leave the office as they are locked securely.We cannot bring the files home to work on them. All file activity has to be completed in the office.

I am still bothered by the sense of loneliness that has wrapped itself around me like a cold, wet blanket. The office is like a ghost town. I didn't realize how much I looked forward to the interactions with clients, prospective clients, doing outreach and being out in the community. I was permitted back on the Federal campus to drop off donations of shampoo and toothpaste, but cannot go into any of the residential programs where I used to do outreach. I feel that the rapport I build with clients that I don't see face to face is lacking.

 I am easily irritated. I actually swore (loud enough for someone to come out of the volunteer office) when I found that the cleaners emptied the fridge on my floor a week early, and I lost some cheese, fruit, and a lunch box since they pitch everything when they do it. The printer jamming, other technology not working,  phone calls and conferences eating up time that I need to put together files and keep up with clients are other irritations. Each week, it seems like they want us to record a new piece of data about our work. We had to learn a brand new system for employee reimbursements. The FEDS sends out new requirements and decisions, expanding the work we do to support Federal social workers when they make twice the salary that we do...What do I do with these irritations? Sometimes I vent. Sometimes I reach for something salty or something sweet. This journal is a new way to vent or process what is happening.

 My church used to host a Thanksgiving Dinner where we got the turkey, mashed potatoes, chicken tenders and gravy from Popeye's,  and people provided the rest. I was the coordinator for the last 4 years. This year, they decided to have a restaurant host it, with COVID precautions. I am ambivalent about going. I think that we will be back in a lockdown by then. The numbers aren't going down anytime soon. I also don't know that I want to expose myself to a large group of people who are all eating (you can't eat with a mask on :)). My neighbor is thinking about a Friendsgiving. That might be more manageable. Socially distanced and with windows open for ventilation...

 We cancelled the family reunion we have around the Fourth of July. I have 1 relative in Illinois. The closest relatives (relationally) are in Michigan. I will not be traveling outside the state of Illinois anytime soon.  That would mean that I have to self-isolate for 14 day before returning to work.

 It's all the uncertainty.  I don't know from one day to the next if I can even go into the office to work. When I work from home, I can't print. I also have to keep moving my cat off my lap so I can type. I don't have the space to spread out or access to the files that I have in the office.

Add to that uncertainty,  the upcoming Election Day... Uncertainty over what level of chaos will ensue. Will we resemble a third world country with unrest, armed soldiers, and a leadership that refuses to transfer power gracefully or peaceably? That of course, assumes that there is regime change and timely results.

I limit my exposure to Media. I try to cook healthy meals. I am going to the chiropractor weekly. I limit my exposure to groups of less than 30 socially distanced. I have yet to go outside for walks. The gym is open but I am hesitant to go. Church is open as well, but there is an average of 100 people there so that is out of the question... There is no more garden work to be done, just planning for next year. I need to schedule a screening and a yearly physical. I still don't see a dentist that is open for routine work yet. And with numbers rising, not sure if that will happen anytime soon. I am feeling really shaggy and in need of a haircut. At least I have my weekly meetings to look forward to. I am fortunate. I have a job with good benefits. My housing is not in jeopardy.strong>A dear friend asked when I thought we would be past most of the pandemic precautions.

We all had completely different experiences from each other,  but we connect back during a pandemic to offer our support and show interest in each other's lives. What was most striking when talking with these different people was that I saw completely different views on the pandemic and how it was directly related to one's culture.

In Australia, a friend told me that they don't even wear masks anymore, as Australia's cases have been extremely low for a long time. Good responses from the government and the citizens have led to more comfort and less anxious life than in many places across the world. We were surprised when she said that they do not wear masking; it was almost unfathomable, unheard of; but when she described that it wasn't necessary, we understood.

I have not ever been this late in making a journal entry before, but I have been stressed this week. I am well aware of the end of the month, and I have been out of work for a month. It seems so wrong to get upset about not having a job when so many more people have been out of work for so much longer.

I have been looking for a way to work from home, but it seems that my hometown may end up experiencing a lack of service from AT&T, the only real service provider out here. Not that it is making much difference at the moment. You see, my computer equipment is limited and aging rapidly with the introduction of a new iPhone next week. I also have problems with lack of training and licensure for some work from home jobs. So much for finding a job over the internet quickly.

 If that wasn’t enough, I received a call from my aunt in Houston. She is one of the few blood relatives that I have left, so every time that I get to speak to her is precious, especially since she is over 90 and in assisted living. The home where she lives has been making fantastic efforts to keep her safe, but they cannot slow the march of time. When her heart started giving her real problems last week and she fainted and fell, she was in the hospital almost immediately. Visiting her became a real priority for me. I haven’t seen her in over a year, and she is due to go into heart surgery tomorrow. I felt I needed to see her before the surgery in case something happened.

 That’s when I found out how sad the state of affairs in my own area is. In four surrounding counties, there is no place that does COVID testing for free. One pharmacy that is listed on the state health department website just charged a neighbor $80 for the privilege of being screened through them. I began looking into options for getting screened myself when I found that the area has no testing to speak of. I was lucky that a visit to the hospital website had a quick prescreen questionnaire and a notice that one visitor per day was allowed after the visitor had their temperature taken. Even though I had called my aunt ahead of time to reserve my 45 minute visit yesterday, I was still stopped because the visitors log said she had already had one visitor that day. I had to plead for time, explaining that I drove three hours to get there. I would have been happy with them minutes. Thankfully, they had moved her to another room, so the log was not accurate.

And all that computer service/communications is sure? It got dicey when I found out that my local gas station no longer accepts the gas card that I have. WOW! The neighbors came through again by pointing me to other stations that work."
21,journal-entry-4558," One obstacle I've faced in the past week has been not getting outside as much as I used to. To keep myself busy and accountable in quarantine I have been running one or two miles every day or every other day to try to give myself something to do and keep myself from going stir crazy. With the weather getting more and more cold and the rain in the past week, I haven't been able to go outside as much and exercise as much as I would have liked. I think this could potentially be an issue with a lot of people as being outside and being with nature has been one constant thing for most people. However, with the cold months moving in, it's hard to be outside without a coat and almost impossible for me personally to run in the cold as my asthma is triggered by both exercise and cold air. I'm worried to see what will come in the coming weeks with the election looming and people going crazy and cooped up in their houses. I hope everyone will just stay safe."
22,journal-entry-4529," ANGER. Re. the New York Times long investigative piece on the Trump-Bolsonaro alliance (a) to get 8,000 Cuban physicians to leave the embattled Indigenous populations of the Amazon; and (b) to defund the Pan American Health Organization which is the most effective and experienced anti-pandemic organization in Latin America. This is one of those things that we, as an educated citizenry, should have been aware of but that slipped under the radar thanks to our enfeebled news media, but also our tendency to protect ourselves from disturbing information and recognitions. I am particularly aggrieved this week about this after having finished a strong article on the Brazilian film, Bacurau, and finding even at the worst in metaphoric recognitions in the reading the film, I underestimated the venality and cruelty of the Trump regime. The attack on Amazonian Indian land rights and general health care (once guaranteed by the Constitution) was an open policy of the Bolsonaro regime, as were the departures of two health ministers in protest against Bolsonaro's promotion of hydroxychloroquine at Trump's encouragement (and supply). But the active dismantlng of health care and pandemic resistance capacity is venality beyond mere corruption (for which both regimes are despised). There is underlying even more dark -- non-conspiracy -- policies routed through our military and Brazil's -- the ideology that all communal land-holdings (such as the Indians') must be be destroyed in favor of individually owned property rights (really!) so as to dispossess the weak through ""legal"" market tactics; and the apparent intentional dissemination of hybrid-cultural warfare (the destruction of supply chains of verifiable information) in order to create chaos that can be opportunistically taken advantage of by those with the corrupt power means (apparently written into US military manuals taught to Brazilian officer forces).

 ANXIETY. Of course, it is not just Brazil, but the COVID-19 virus fueling the hysteria (chaos, see above) surrounding the U.S. Presidential elections, which the Republicans are doing their utmost to disrupt through voter suppression in a replay of the Jim Crow backlash against Reconstruction. There is a heartening determination of millions of voters to vote early, but an astounding closeness in the polling with half the American populace cheering Trump on. (Good news from Bolivia which was able to hold an election despite a polarized country.) The COVID-19 rates continue to rise (or perhaps are rising again) -- Massachusetts had 1200 cases again yesterday. Trump has so politicized the wearing of protective masks that one can see crowds without masks bunched together at his political rallies, while others wear masks and socially distance, and the Biden campaign has popularized the drive-in rally. The battle of my virus against your immune system! Among our own friends, a psychiatrist colleague is recovering from a two week but mild case of COVID-19 (he's itching to get back into the hospital); another anthropologist friend lost her father to COVID-19 in India and cannot go to the funeral, just like our American Indian colleague who lost his father a week ago and had to watch the funeral on zoom.

Meanwhile. Trump continues to dismantle the government, most recently attempting to take civil service protections away from government employees, and continuing a long term struggle to disempower the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York from pursuing a large-scale gold smuggling operation between Tehran-Ankara-the UAE- and China, in violation of sanctions against Iran. I have no love for the sanctions, but Erdogan's game of enmeshing the Trump regime in its own corruption has been hovering around the Trump administration since day one and General Flynn's work for both Erdogan and Putin. Soon we took will be in the position of the village of Bacurau.

 INTELLECTUAL NOURISHMENT. Today we had a wonderful 3 hour long Friday morning seminar on the fungibility of ghosts and repressions of painful pasts that are powerfully stirred up by events in the present, from the fear in Gus Dur's efforts to deal with the massacres of 1965 while keeping the ""dark forces"" at bay, to Charlottesville's calling forth of KKK and Nazi psychodynamics, to exorcisms as benign templates (even when both entertaining and terrifying) for viewing people (hardly entertaining but equally displaced) as intimate traitors and evil maop (ghosts), and such return to U.S. repression as hinted above and pictured allusively in the film Bacurau. How to live responsibly in a world where the forces at play are hidden and the very subject of psychology is a ""barred self"" unable to discern when it is acting out of haunted displacements.

4,journal-entry-4457," my elder daughter is in the 1st grade. after two weeks in school, the lockdown (is israel) drew her back home.  she was very sad that her promised school was taken from her so soon, and she cried a lot.  school continued through the zoom - the school sent the parents a very impressive timetable with 3-4 classes a day (40 minutes - 1 hour each) - but not all 6-years-old kids survived this fancy timetable. my daughter didn't. i sat with her for a few hours, and then realized that she doesn't understand anything of what's being said.  after the first few experiences, she refused to continue. i saw how much she suffered -  it was as if she withered on her chair, she couldn't hold her head up; and she pressed her eyes so hard she almost bruised herself - so i didn't force her to continue. now, a month and a half later, school is about to resume, and i'm worried. i taught her some by myself, as much as i could, but the teacher swept forward, and taught through the zoom reading, writing, and arithmetic, leaving behind all the ""zoom-disabled"" kids. school now made her a ""problematic"" student just because she didn't get alone with the zoom.  i'm worries that this new sense of inferiority is going to ruin her once-joyous motivation to study."

I've been overwhelmed between work, distance learning for my son, and just the general heightened level of difficulty and stress that the pandemic has brought, and it has led to me just having a lot less energy and time for DSA meetings and organizing work.

 But you bet your ass I was at my meeting that Sunday. And I have some N95 masks now, so It's feeling less reckless to get out there and organize. We've got to grind these people into the ground so far they never come back."

Super satisfying to use a new drain tool to get the bathroom sink unclogged and wishing it could be an omen that ugly scum can be removed (from office). Things like this are much more interesting to me since the pandemic since we're always home.

Ugly incident where restaurant across the street which has been making really unacceptable levels of noise since they began outdoor dining, has a super loud party on a Tuesday night and when I call to complain, the owner lets the birthday girl curse at me, taunt me, accuse me of being racist (how would she even know there is a difference in race between us when talking on the phone?) and hang up on me. Hard to sleep afterwards. We are all really on edge but it's still not okay what happened.

One of our apartment building neighbors from the new list wants to set up a Zoom call to introduce ourselves to each other! How sweet. It's very helpful to hear from them too that not only are we not the only ones being bothered by the restaurant noise but one of our neighbors wants to move out of the building because it's like having a party next door every night. I think her window faces the restaurant more directly.

High school friend on Facebook says her healthy 85-year-old father has died suddenly of covid. He was a lovely man and a staunch philanthropist and community leader.

Quite a good constructive conversation with the co-owner of the restaurant across the street which ends on a friendly note. Really hoping it will lead to actual improvement. I feel powerful for having pursued the matter further. He apologized profusely for last night. A difficult part of this is that he is white and the loud angry restaurant patron mentioned that she was Black, and I have to wonder from the profuseness of his apology whether he made her uncomfortable celebrating at his restaurant and so the whole blast of anger between her and me had something to do with white spaces and how Black people have to decide whether to try to suppress parts of themselves to be acceptable there -- was she being extra loud to try to take the space that was subtly unwelcoming to her? I don't know this restaurant guy but I still wish I could have figured out a way to talk to him about that, and I feel ashamed.

Our local pharmacy is closing and the nearest one will now be really difficult for me to walk to given my usual pain level. It's probably because they weren't getting enough business in the pandemic.

So touching and beautiful that the pope made clear today that he supports gay unions. What a lovely surprise.

Noticing today how much I love that S is always home with me, working from home, hardly any time away from home. I will miss all this sweet togetherness whenever it ends.

It is so bananas insane that the President had the same password for his Twitter account as he gives out for wifi at rallies. And no 2-factor authentication. That doesn't bode well for security of anything else he touches. Like the nuclear football.

Crying over a video of Biden comforting the son of the Parkland heroic shooting victim, holding him and kissing him on the head. I think all of us are that boy right now -- we're not okay, Biden! Please rescue us! And also, what a beautiful vision, a politician being so genuinely nurturing. I miss President Obama with tearful intensity.

L, the same person who made the hilarious ballot box video, went to the ER this morning because she has a painful swelling in her throat and her covid test results from 3 days ago still aren't back so her doctor doesn't want her coming in there, and meanwhile her daughter can't go to school...

Our good friend C got her first acting job since the pandemic. She wrote, attaching a picture of herself with a bag of surgical masks: ""First booking since Covid. Luckily, it’s a Netflix show and by all accounts, they have the strictest policies to keep everyone safe.  Instead of a fitting, I had a pcr test a couple of days ago.  I was asked to stay extra vigilant between booking and shooting. Had to download an app with daily questionnaires on my health.  Another PCR test when I arrived.  Mountains of documents all sent to me virtually.  No more paper scripts or sides.  A long list of what I can expect on set was sent immediately after my booking. A large bag of PPE was given to me when I arrived. Crew wears tracking watches for contact tracing.  I’m only allowed to take off my mask in my dressing room, in the make up chair, and when filming.  It feels like this is the only show shooting on the entire lot. All in all, I feel much safer than a trip to smart and final.  This is the new normal for a while.""

Because of my identity having been stolen (for covid relief fraud) and some scary notifications lately that people in India and other countries are trying to get into my Google account, we spent a bunch of money getting two physical security keys and now I'm protected by Advanced Protection -- nobody can sign in to my account on a new device without one of these keys. Now need to make sure the physical keys are in separate and convenient enough places!

At the beginning of the pandemic I was terrified the supply chain for everything would fail. So far no,but it makes me anxious that our Amazon subscribe and save (which we do feel guilty about using given their atrocious labor practices but we can't go to stores!) has begun to cancel more of our subscriptions, last month the cat treats, bamboo supplement and Allerpet cat dander treatment. We need those things and I'm anxious that we won't be able to get them reliably.

Attended the pet loss grief support group in Michigan via Zoom and really got a lot out of it this time, cried hard over our lost cat and was able to comfort a person who just put her cat to sleep last week. ""He thought he was going to wake up with me like normal. And he was still so alert and purring when I took care of him."" I kept crying about that all day, remembering how agonizing that was for us, putting our beloved baby to sleep when she still might have been able to have good days. Comforted myself about thinking about how guilty we might have felt if we had seen she was having terrible days, instead of having them looming. Our goodbye with her was so loving and sweet, and we couldn't have had that beautiful last few days if we hadn't acted before she was in agony. I miss her so painfully and feel a grief related to bonding more with our current cat, as well as the climate of loss and death in this pandemic era. I think I saw this recently on Twitter: ""Why do we have to love those who we will lose? Because there's nobody else to love.""

Shiva minyan for R who I barely know. Because of Zoom there are a lot of random people there who don't understand what shiva is and I explained it for them and gently urged them to be quiet and listen to R. I will really miss being able to attend so many shiva minyanim when we go back to having them in person. Also felt worried afterwards that I had talked too much, just second guessing myself.

Baked pluot cobbler from the paper-plate-scribbled recipe B gave us and thinking of her with love, wishing she would come out of her coma.

I watched the debate to the extent I could stand it, and I'm so glad it's over, but hard to sleep afterwards. Really preoccupied with wanting to eat irrational things and feeling so anxious about whether the lunatic might win again. It would be such a catastrophe. He already has been.

10/23/20

Such a cliche nightmare last night, I have a part in a play but I've never rehearsed it and don't know my lines and they expect me to have come up with a song and someone in the cast has covid! And I'm trying to get there but my cat is in the car and might get out...

Delightful talk with my aunt. I asked her, in these scary times, is there anything else you would want to have said to me if G-d forbid we never got to speak again? And we thanked each other for how close we are and told each other some of the things that make our relationship so precious (honesty, how we get each other, how we can say anything). J's daughter and her husband seem to have a reinfection of covid, oh no! As if that family hasn't been through enough!

10/24/20

Sweet restful shabbos evening eating pluot cobbler in honor of B and thinking about her.

E's bat mitzvah. We wouldn't have been able to attend if it weren't over Zoom because I couldn't travel that far, so it was very moving and lovely to be with them and see them present her with her homemade tallit and see her burst immediately into tears -- loved having her be so open about her emotions. She spoke eloquently about how the trauma of having to leave her birth family left her with challenges, and noticed that Noah and the animals on the ark had to leave so much  behind and must have grieved so deeply for everything they lost. Bawled our eyes out. Also felt jealous of A and C for being honored during the service. Once we were closer to that family and would have been honored, ouch.

Just before lunchtime, thunderbolt news: R, C's girlfriend, one of S's bandmates, is positive for covid. S was just there a week ago for band practice, out in the yard. She probably didn't catch it until after he was there, thinks she got it from a gathering with coworkers out in their yard to eat pizza (they also go out to the grocery store to do their own shopping unlike us), but this is definitely the nearest it's come to us. The biggest risks we have taken are S going to pick up and ship packages inside a UPS store (twice now), going inside his practice space building, and going to C's yard for outdoor, distanced band practice, and I am really stunned and scared by this proximity to us. I hope they'll be okay! We have sent them a food delivery gift card. But of course, as human minds do, ours turn to what this means for us. This could really put the kibosh on band practice for S, which is part of what keeps him going. By the time they're out of quarantine the weather could start being more unreliable, really can't practice in the rain outside. Now we are debating, should we get tested ourselves? I look into testing at home and find in the act of exploring I have accidentally finalized an order for at home tests from Safeway to be delivered tomorrow, no payment has been collected or anything, but if we want to go through with this it would be almost $300 and we don't know whether our insurance will reimburse any of it. That might be too much for just a peace of mind/knowing we don't have to quarantine test. Meanwhile sent a message to our doctor's office asking if we even need to get tested.

10/25/20

Didn't sleep well, bad pain, nightmares about our cat swallowing a needle (eek!!).

To my surprise, the doctor's office answers yes, we must quarantine and get tested. So we've made appointments tomorrow for what we hope can be a drive-through test (it's definitely outside at a tent, one way or the other). 

What really helps with quarantine this morning is the Window Swap website -- I luck into one with a snowy window and watch it for quite a while and tell myself it's too snowy to go outside (it actually doesn't ever snow in our climate).

We just filmed and submitted our own window recently and hope it gives someone else a similar feeling sometime.

C posting about her pod and how they are getting ready to have a first birthday party for little R makes me feel sad and left out. Wish we could have a pod.

10/26/20

It was exciting to go outside of our apartment today even though it was to go get the first in-person covid test I've had (I sent in swab and blood samples to a public health study before). I haven't been out since Friday morning, generally rest inside on Shabbat and started quarantine Saturday night. It's a beautiful bright day!

I was a bit nervous because the instructions for the appointment at the mobile testing center were vague (""this site accommodates both drive-through and walk-up appointments""). Because of my physical condition, when I go somewhere new, I don't know how well it's going to go for me -- I can't stand in a line for very long (I can usually walk around longer than I can stand still, but that isn't always feasible and especially might not work for a socially distanced line, which I have never yet stood in because we don't go shopping). I brought my cane and the kinds of pain relief I would be able to use in that situation (heat patch mainly, which I'm not using much of these days), and I tried to call the front office as the appointment drew near to confirm that I'd be able to stay reclined in the car, but couldn't get through on the phone, so both of us were feeling a little worried. I was also remembering the time I got swabbed for swine flu in I think 2009, which was a pretty uncomfortable test -- they really jammed the swab way far up into my sinuses. Wasn't looking forward to having that done again, and was a bit concerned that S would start having a dramatic nosebleed from something being stuck so far up his nose. We pondered before we left about the Nozin disinfectant stuff we usually put around the edge of our noses before leaving the apartment (something we've been doing since late 2019 after reading about it in the NY Times) and decided it's totally contraindicated when going to have one's nose swabbed for virus -- funny that they wouldn't instruct us to be careful about not putting anything in our noses before the test because I would think that would matter!

I enjoyed being on the freeway on the way there because I haven't been on the freeway since we took a nature walk in July during our ""pandemic vacation"" time off at home. This tent testing center is set up in the parking lot of a store where we used to shop for Passover every year, since closed.

The test was anticlimactic, a big relief -- we pulled in, they confirmed who we were, and the nurse practitioner came around to each window to do the swab. S barely felt it, for me it was a little unpleasant, maybe because I have to be reclined to be in the car and the angle made it go further in? I felt like I was either going to sneeze or burst out inappropriately laughing as she tickled the far reaches of my sinuses with prolonged swirly thoroughness, because honestly it felt a little violating, but I did neither, and then we were finished. We will get test results by Fri and we need to quarantine until then.

Our cat was confused and unhappy about our both being gone for about an hour. She's not used to that these days!

Meanwhile the sociopath in chief is poised on the verge of making the Supreme Court 6-3 full of right wing zealots who will kill people and destroy their lives for many years to come. It raises my blood pressure so much and I feel so helpless.

That's it -- the vote is done and they confirmed her. I'm just sick with helpless rage and dread. She will go start destroying our lives tomorrow. My friend T just got married this weekend and their wedding could be ruled illegitimate by this right wing extremist they have confirmed tonight.

10/27/20

Trouble sleeping, so upset about Amy Coney Barrett. In RBG's seat! In RBG's quarters! As if she were qualified, a person who has never argued a case in front of the Supreme Court! Glee from the right, GOP account tweeting that she was confirmed with ""Happy birthday Hillary,"" (so petty and juvenile), the fact that they held ANOTHER unmasked please-super-spread event to celebrate even though they know the event to introduce her was a super spreader!, and just dreading the way this packed court will try to steal the election and deny rights to women, people of color, LGBTQIA+ people... During the night our sweet cat snuggled up so close to me, I don't know if I was clutching her with a special intensity or it's just getting a little chillier or what, but she was putting her little feet in the crook of my elbow as I held her, and it was so reassuring and helped me sleep some.

Hate not being able to go out for a walk until we get our covid test results. H in Kenya tells me they get covid test results in 24 hours. Ours could take 4 days."
9,journal-entry-4450," I joined a new social justice group 

as though to scap myself back together

from the hostile work environment from a previous social justice organization that I dedicated 10 years of my life to.

I feel  bittersweet as I nostalgically look back at what I have done for them, how I have grown and had to leave to flourish in a new community 

And so,  here I am now, reconnecting with a religious church, with an upcoming social justice group formed back in June 2020 and  yet I feel like I can do so much more with my own curriculum development as a doctoral student.

So much within the unknown and as my eyes struggle to stay awake from exhaustion, tears, and tiredness that drag me down as I push myself to complete more.

 Social media has reinforced the notion that I will eternally be enough to never be enough. The constant internal battle I have with myself, about having to maintain my femininity by being think, to idealize marriage and my own body's capabilities to have children.. I find myself lost in the social constructs within our society I am stuck between a red and blue pill just like the matrix. Only this time, the blue pill is a hoax like our president; made of something that can fill me up and be processed through to continue the lie we all live in. The red pill is the only option to sustain my bloodflow as I learn new things about myself."
10,journal-entry-4452,"It's interesting because  my family is split across the world right now because my mom happened to travel to Senegal right before the pandemic started and has been stuck there since March just like I was stuck in the US since March as well. I've thought about her and my father plenty since the start of the pandemic mainly because they are more at risk from coronavirus and because they've been separated from one another for 7 months now. I feel like I've focused enough on negatives today though, so instead,  I want to talk about the positive things that have occurred due to their separation. They work really well together so it's been fascinating to hear how they've been managing their lives alone, like how  my dad has learned how to cook things that he's never cooked before and is packing up the house by himself which is usually what my mom used to do when we moved. On  my mother's side, she started a business in Senegal while being stuck there which is something she probably would not have been able to do if she came back to Thailand which is awesome."
11,journal-entry-4423,"Well, this one will be short for me because  before the Pandemic I wasn't using Social Media very much, and now I'm really not using it at all. I find that Social Media is the source of a lot of misinformation and hype that really isn't out there - I've seen it push friends and family to the extremes of their political/social beliefs when I really don't think that's where they're at. It was bad before the Pandemic, but with everyone separated from everyone else, Social Media has become a place where more people go to connect with others and then, instead they are pushed to even more extreme views because they're believing the misinformation and the hype that's out there. I stay off of it, especially since I don't have the time to decipher and research what's real and what's not. I can connect directly with my friends and family via phone, text, email, in-person, online chats, etc. I don't need Social Media. Actually, I think I'm a happier person not being on Social Media (I'm definitely less stressed)."

I guess if one is to be locked in a house or apartment, the best scenario is to at least be trapped with the person you can never get tired of.

Overall, I think I'm literally just burned out. There is so much that we have to deal with on a day to day basis in a normal college life and theres also a pandemic which makes everything 100 times more complicated.

The loss of live worship services and the loss of our Care and Concern Director has left me feeling abandoned. How do you care for a congregation in a pandemic with no Director? How do you mobilize volunteers without one?

There are times when the sense of loneliness is deeper. Nowhere to ""hang out"" now that the weather has turned cold, wet, and windy. More lockdowns seem to be in the forecast as the numbers keep climbing. I am tired of COVID precautions. It is this letting down the guard that spreads this latest wave. People are covid-fatigued, and want to be with family and friends.

Beyond that, I have been utterly demoralized by the politicization of the pandemic. IT IS NOT A HOAX!! People are literally dying from attending funerals, weddings, and birthday parties. Political rallies and other mass events become super-spreaders because people are not taking Covid-19 seriously. It is ""someone else's"" problem.

I am anxious about Election Day and the prospect of voter harassment. I don't understand why police are still killing African Americans at the rate they do.

The pandemic has made my job doubly difficult! There is too much to do virtually that takes three times as long as when we could do it in person. So many more people are in danger of foreclosure or eviction. Some of the people that call me haven't worked in 5-6 months. I can see the handwriting on the wall. Once they get back to work, we will have another lockdown. Then there will truly be a homeless population close in scale to the refugees.

I am NOT ready for the Fall Back off of Daylight Savings Time.

In a meeting, someone shared that we need to revive our dreams.

Perhaps I am too informed. I hang out with epidemiologists and stay on top of the numbers myself. I have risk factors, so I am very, very careful. I never let anyone inside my home, with the rare exception of a technician who needs access to my basement. In that case, they enter and exit via the bulkhead with no contact with me – and I keep the basement closed off from the rest of the house for days. I never let anyone in my car, except for repairs – and that is really very stressful… lots of disinfecting ensues and I let the car air out in the garage for days.

I am very careful. I haven’t seen the inside of a store since last February. I only occasionally get take-out food, and I treat the packaging like hazardous material. Food is then microwaved prior to eating. I talk to people by phone or Zoom, and only visit my son outside, with masks, and distanced. This happens rarely as he has recently relocated a bit closer to me but is busy with work and fixing up his new house.

I am very careful – but I live alone all of the time. The isolation is the very worst part of being very careful.

My blessings? I can work at home, I have a house with a bulkhead and garage. I am financially OK with good health insurance. My kids are grown – so I don’t have to worry about their education.

Reconozco que mi mala salud es mi responsabilidad en buena medida. Nunca quise hacer ejercicio, he tenido una vida sedentaria; tal vez no como mucha comida chatarra, pero soy muy golosa; si estoy enferma y no tengo dinero, no hago nada por ir al médico, me quedo así. En resumen: he tratado mi cuerpo con poco respeto y cuidado. Lo reconozco.

El 13 de agosto tuve una gripe muy fuerte que duró dos semanas y los síntomas coincidían con el COVID 19. Por cuestiones económicas, no pude realizarme la prueba de COVID 19. En el 2017 tuve un derrame pleural en uno de lo pulmones. En agosto 2020, tuve algunos de los mismos síntomas que experimenté en esa ocasión, pero por la falta de dinero no pude realizarme una radiografía para ver qué estaba pasando en el pulmón. Solo sentí dolor, no podía respirar y mi capacidad respiratoria decayó mucho. Pero logré salir de la enfermedad con la medicación que tenía en casa.

Debido a la pandemia, tuve que buscar que mis familiares me atendieran y eso ha significado mudarme. Además, me quedé con una capacidad respiratoria limitada (no puedo subir gradas, me cuesta caminar las distancias largas, no soporto que fumen cerca de mí porque me pongo ronca y me ahogo, por ejemplo). Aun con esto, creo que he recuperado un poco la capacidad respiratoria en estas semanas.

Realmente no le hago mucho caso al cuerpo, si lo logro levantar de la cama todas las mañanas es que estoy bien. Yo vivo en mi mente. Al combinar mi mente y mi voluntad logro vivir. Y ellas se encargan de arrastrar el cuerpo a lo que sea. Así es y así ha sido."

The feeling of a swarm of flies buzzing in my head

Of my back hurting after working for 12 hours at my computer

Drinking some wine to feel a bit better only to find myself sinking down further

Into new rabbit holes I didn't even knew existed until I arrived. 

The feeling of being overwhelmed

Constantly drowning in work and trying my best

Feeling the sun set with my energy and yet still I must rise

To finish working into the next day. "

He also doesn't like school as much as he once did. I'm worried that he will stop liking school. He is doing okay with the assignments, but I have to be much more involved than I was planning to be for his schooling. The school is doing a decent job.

5,journal-entry-4285,"I gave birth to my little girl three weeks ago.. Just as a 'second wave' was beginning to affect Greece. I have been extremely happy due to the arrival of my beautiful daughter, but I also have a ton of emotions, positive, mixed and sometimes even negative, as is usual in this stage after birth.. where hormones and emotions all run very high.

The re-rise of Covid-19 in my country has also affected me quite negatively. I am afraid to meet people, and to introduce my daughter to anyone but my relatives. I don't know how long this will last, which is the scariest part of it all. nor how many victims we are yet to count, globally.

I am also afraid that the blow on the economy at this second stage, on a pan-European scale, will be huge.

Generally, I am cautious and fearful, but I am also filled with optimism. Perhaps it's because I gave birth to new life, and this breeds hope.

I keep comparing our current era to a century ago; the interwar period, which was full of violence, the rise of fascism, and uncertainty. And I think, ""it's not as bad as then, at least""."

Obviously, there is the down side to this--much less human contact all around with our friends.

I know it's stressful for parents, and it's been hard for parents to get their work done, some of my friends with little kids say their children have never been happier--they get to stay home with their parents all day! No day care. No having to get up early and leave the house. So maybe for the little kids some of this will turn out to be okay.

I have faith that if Biden wins that he will immediately put in place a plan to deal with COVID, and try and bring people back together. I am actually feeling in my bones that this national nightmare will soon be over. I truly hope I am right.

I had a great experience on Sunday. A neighborhood clinic in conjunction with the Giant Supermarket was offering free flu shots and free Covid testing. My spouse and son and I all went and got flu shots. When we got there, the woman checking us in asked if we had insurance, even though it was free. She explained that everyone who had insurance was helping the effort, because the more the clinic got reimbursed by private insurance, the more shots and tests they could offer. We were happy to contribute. Happy that in some small way, in our progressive community, clinics and businesses are pitching in to protect everyone's health. Pitching in where the federal government has failed miserably.

Although this effort was private, this is what public health would look like, if we had it. I'm pretty sure that if most Americans understood what public health care truly was--i.e. you walk up to your local clinic and get all your vaccines for free, they would support it. Our lack of any kind of public health care is truly a fault of politics, greed, and imagination--people unable to imagine the positive impact on society if we were ALL cared for by a public system."

Last Thursday they announced that most students (other than first years, and I am a sophomore) would once again be fully online and unable to live on campus during the spring semester (Jan-May). I am deeply devastated by this news, especially because my school is split into two campuses and next semester would have been my last at the first campus. Additionally, I have only seen one friend from school since the pandemic began, and I miss the rest of my friends greatly. It has been so strange to adjust to life as a college student without a social life, club activities, office hours, hanging out on the quad, and eating in the dining hall. I am mourning the loss of that once again, just like I did in March and August. So this week I have been scrambling a bit to figure out where I'll be living next semester, if there is any way to make this feel more normal while still being safe, and yearning to see the friends I haven't seen in 8 months."

It makes me so incredibly sad that we live in a world that science is politicized and people are dying because of it. The especially sad part about this is that politics shouldn't result in the death of thousands of people, but here it is, happening in real time.

A lot of people in the media have been talking about how mail in voting is a huge source of fraud in the US, which I think is just another way that the pandemic is effecting our lives. Those who are at higher risk for the virus would have to go to the polls and risk their lives in order to vote.

I am scared of the possibility that we will not come back for the spring term. We have been doing so well thus far, but that can change at any moment. What this means for me is that if we do go remote, then I will struggle with fulfilling the requirements for my studio art major. I mentioned a couple weeks ago how much I dislike my virtual art class because I am not taking it in the studio. Early in the week, I was talking with one of my art professors about the requirements for fulfilling my major. She showed me the list of courses I need to complete for the major and as I looked through it, I noticed some courses that I can take and have the same experience both in-person and virtual. It gave me hope because I would have the amazing studio experience and complete the requirements simultaneously. I now know that this is completely doable. Another aspect I have been struggling with is work study. Given the limited job options due to COVID-19, I have not been able to find any jobs on campus. This worried me because I have to do so for financial aid, in addition to making my own money. I am even more concerned because this problem may occur next semester regardless whether we are in-person or remote. However, now that I am aware of the issue, I am better prepared to take action moving forward. I realize that this pandemic has caused so much trouble for everyone. Now that I see it has affected my academics, I am frightened by what will happen next.

En noviembre tenemos una festividad importante relacionada con nuestros muertos. Por el COVID 19, será imposible visitar los cementerios. Me enoja porque el gobierno ha abierto los centros comerciales, pero se niega a abrir los cementerios. De esa festividad dependen muchos vendedores informales de flores, de comida, bueno... hasta de mariachis. De nuevo, privilegia a los dueños de grandes tiendas, pero deja en la peor situación a los vendedores informales.

Y sí, ya sé que media humanidad puede contagiarse al ir a los cementerios, pero de la misma forma, cada quien está tomando decisiones sobre esa posibilidad cuando visita los centros comerciales con sus plazas de comida y sus tiendas. Todo se reduce a esa decisión individual sobre arriesgarse al contagio o no al levantar el confinamiento y los toques de queda.

El COVID 19 arrasa con nuestras costumbres y ritos. Costumbres y ritos que nos hacen colectividad y nos hacen sentir que pertenecemos a un grupo más amplio y más grande que nosotros mismos. Costumbres y ritos que, a veces, menospreciamos o vemos con condescendencia cuando somos jóvenes, rebeldes y críticos, pero que con el avance de los años, comprendemos que dan una cohesión y proporcionan unos lazos con la comunidad a la que pertenecemos, aunque a veces nos den ganas de dinamitarla desde las raíces.

El COVID 19 vino a quedarse. Veo la lucha de las personas por seguir conectadas entre sí, por reunirse, por compartir como lo hacíamos antes. Les valen poco las restricciones. Porque no hacerlo nos lleva a la locura, a la depresión, a la deshumanización. El COVID 19 vino a quedarse, pero la gente seguirá desafiándolo en nombre del encuentro, de los lazos, del toque humano, de la colectividad, de la presencialidad."

A good change might be attitudes toward computers and people of all ages becoming much more adept at computers.Maybe in 30 years something will have been discovered that is better than computers, Who knows?

Maybe the Supreme Court will have 20 Justices!! Who knows.

the scattered parts seem like a dream as the rain showers me as though to cleanse the vibration of olds past

trying to find solace in something

This system was put in place not to help those in need or take of the needs of the people but to still keep black and brown bodies below or at the bottom. From what I've gathered it makes more sense for African Americans to create their own nation divided from all the other mess that American claims to provide. It's said that America is land of the free, but how when it was built off of the backs of enslaved black and brown bodies. So called the American dream and when African Americans are being racially profiled, murdered and disrespected on the daily. Now this COVID virus which is killing many of our friends and family.

S got his first ever flu shot (because of his allergy to most kinds of flu shot)! The allergist nurse brought it out to the car. Not much of a reaction at all. Great to have him protected from flu this season of covid!

P told me about her poor friend who has 5 children, can't speak English very well, just lost her husband who died of covid and is distraught. Their community is treating them like lepers and they're so crushed with grief and terror. Meanwhile the sociopath in chief has a hospital suite with a dining room with a chandelier and then goes home to a functioning clinic inside his residence. It's so unbelievably unfair.

It's Sukkot. We got to spend some time in the sukkah of two strangers, thanks to our synagogue's matching program. It was very awkward that D hadn't set up everything and so was bustling around too close to me, but it was outside and everyone was masked so I tried not to freak out about it, they were doing us such an enormous favor to let us come! It's actually the first time I've had to negotiate that kind of distance issue because we mostly just shelter in place except for walks.

They left everything we might need, plus hand sanitizer, and they brought their chaise lounge out for me to lie down on, and had an extension cord for my heating pad... Their sukkah was ugly and sad, almost no shade from scraggly twigs and very minimal decorations, but it was all we have this year. S brought his banjo to play. It was too hot because of the lack of shade but it was still incredibly sweet.

S couldn't run because of the air quality from wildfire smoke so he took a long walk to bring our extra paper bags to donate to a meal program for the homeless.

I finally succeeded in getting the third of 3 freezes placed with the 3 credit bureaus (still aftermath of getting my identity stolen to apply for covid disaster relief)! Equifax took the longest. I burst into tears when the representative told me I had to send them more documents. When I told her the date I had already sent copies of my passport, driver's license and social security card, she was able to find them (why couldn't she find them before she made me cry?) and it turned out happily because finally I placed the freeze! All of this identity theft saga since my identity was stolen to apply for covid disaster relief has been the most ridiculous ordeal. It took more than a month to get my credit fully locked down.

Over Zoom I got to chat with some new people from my synagogue. It was so delightful to have an in-depth conversation with someone new! Easier to achieve because of the pandemic. 

We're trying meal delivery from a local movie theater that usually serves food and has pivoted its business model. Not so great and probably not going to get used again often. But it's nice we supported them a little.

I can't help hoping he will have a covid crash like some do after a week or so. The poor staff at the White House, so many of whom are older people of color. I'm so glad Pelosi is acknowledging the need to invoke the 25th amendment even though her effort will not pass.

But it's honestly for the best that one of the remaining 2 ""debates"" has been cancelled because they don't help change anyone's mind and they just create more stress.

I can't actually believe the New England Journal of Medicine and Scientific American have come out against Trump -- not exactly the most political publications! I don't end up even mentioning some of the most bonkers news in here (the terrorist plot to kidnap Gov Whitener!) because I'm just too exhausted by the unending stream of head-whipping shock and terror.

Enjoyed our weekend even though it made me very sad that Simchat Torah felt like a complete dud -- the services by night were stupid and there weren't any by morning, and when I tuned in to a minyan in LA by zoom it was just stiff singing with backs to the camera. I don't feel like I got a real holiday season this year and can't believe it's over.

R had her periodic cancer scan this morning and at the hospital they didn't have a proper surgical mask for her and wouldn't let her wear her own mask into the MRI for fear of hidden metal, so she had a mask that looked like a torn sheet of paper, no seal to her nose at all. PPE shortages continue, though nothing about them is in the news.

Woke up super grumpy and lethargic with an upset stomach. Allowed myself a very slow start which made me available when s found out his beloved former boss B had an aneurysm and has been in a coma. Her family can't be with her because of covid and he wonders if she would come out of it if they could hold her hand and talk to her. It was merciful that he was working from home so he could cry with me and tell me about it.

I think part of what's making me feel not great physically is eating very carby cheap food without enough protein because that's all we have this week.

S had to do the riskiest thing he has done since the pandemic began, take his steel guitar to the UPS store for shipping for repair. He wore an n95 with the valve taped plus a face shield and gloves, and they were only letting in one person at a time. Weird and unsettling but went as well as it could have.

Cuando el Papa caminó completamente solo por la plaza de San Pedro para dar aquella bendición universal supe que estábamos tan solos como él y que esa no era buena señal sobre lo que íbamos a enfrentar.

La economía ha podido más que el cuidado de la vida y estamos de vuelta. Saltan los cierres de las restricciones y podemos salir. Al salir sentimos que nos estamos acercando a la ""normalidad"" anterior. De nuevo, la ampliación del espacio nos devuelve un poco del tiempo que conocíamos. Pero el hacha del COVID 19 pende siempre sobre nuestro cuello y el de las personas que queremos.

¿Volverán el tiempo y el espacio a parecernos coherentes y rutinarios? No lo creo."
10,journal-entry-3963,"Este año, y los acontecimientos recientes, han cambiado por completo mi rutina y mi estado de ánimo.

La manera en como me despierto, la comida de todos los días, los sonidos alrededor, y las mismas paredes que me rodean han sido parte de mi día a día y se ha convertido en algo por lo que me resulta difícil de manejar.

De todas formas, establecer una nueva rutina que se adapte a mis nuevas oportunidades ha servido de gran ayuda para mantener mi mente ocupada e inquieta.

Es importante que, ha pesar de hundirme en un agujero que no existe, siempre debo ver la luz al final del túnel."

12,journal-entry-3967,"The pandemic changed everything, every second of every day was affected, from leaving the house and putting a mask on to not seeing loved ones in order to protect one another. It changed how we interact and how our politics killed hundreds of thousands of lives. It showed how one person became a cult leader of a political party at the expense of his citizens he was supposed to serve. It changed everyone I know, from all parts of the world.

It changed me."
13,journal-entry-3949,"I have not seen my mom in person in almost a year. I didn't get to visit for Mother's Day or her birthday or just to go because I missed her. I have decided to go for Thanksgiving, but there are caveats. I will wear a mask and maintain a distance. Normally at Thanksgiving, we have a family reunion with aunts, uncles, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Only a couple of her grandkids (2 live next door to her) will be there and no great-grandkids. Her sister and brother-in-law won't be there. No traditional girls' breakfast at Craker Barrel on Saturday morning (I still haven't eaten in a restaurant). Nothing is normal when you can't hug and kiss your mom."
14,journal-entry-3948,"I was watching a high school football game (in my state) on ESPN this past Friday night. The stands were PACKED. There was NO social distancing or mask-wearing. It was an abomination. In my opinion, there is no excuse for a school system or community to allow that. The pandemic is not over. Today in our state, there were over 900 reported cases. Why would you endanger the lives of those in your community? To me, it is a selfish act to disregard the effect of your actions on others. Shouldn't a school system be teaching its students to care for others? To do what is right instead of what is popular? Makes me think about our governor, giving in to pressure and not doing what is best for the state as a whole. Sad."
15,journal-entry-3936,"Sorry but I do not feel like writing a lot this week. Overall, the pandemic has made this week draining. I am approaching midterms for my grad program and having all courses online has been exhausting. Also, I am a supervisor for my universities contact tracing program. This week has been extremely busy and it makes me wonder how much long they can continue to have in person classes. I think they are going to push it until November, but I believe it is reckless and causes extreme harm to the local community. Also, I went for a walk on campus Saturday evening and passed by a large group of students. As I passed by them, I heard a girl say ""... yeah I am supposed to be in quarantine right now."" That was pretty demotivating..."

17,journal-entry-3955,"Because of the pandemic, I wasn't enrolled in school last semester -- this lead to me scrambling to find opportunities during the summer and trying to find really, anything, to make me feel productive. Ultimately, I ended up overburdening myself - I took on too many part time jobs and found that as I got move involved with them, they all began to ask more of me, escalating responsibilities towards the mid summer months, when I was working more than 15 hours a day, all in meetings on Zoom. I think the worst part wasn't necessarily the work - it was the time I had to spend on Zoom, and the fact that I had to bring my brightest personality to all of these calls whether it be tutoring and trying to sound excited about the SAT, or doing sales calls and doing my best to look on top of it and professional, when internally, I began to overwhelm and exhaust myself. I also had very, very poor internet through most of quarantine - well below average than what most of us have access to now in school (I hope!) and well below the national average. This meant that during Zoom calls, I was either awkwardly frozen, seeing frozen faces, or had to dial in via phone. This sometimes caused a lot of anxiety, like when a student got mad at me for the poor internet and wanted to reschedule their session entirely - which would've been a whole process for me since my schedule was so packed. I'm still continuing to work during the school semester, and while I've been trying really hard to create some boundaries, I still regularly get overwhelmed when I look at a particularly heavy schedule of social Zooming and having to maintain that face."
18,journal-entry-3917,"For this weeks journal entry, I wanted to focus on how the pandemic has affected the economic status of my family. At the beginning of COVID-19, there was a general sense of being uncertain what the future holds. As things got worse, and more restrictions were being enacted, being uncertain turned into worry. My dad ended up losing his job working as head of sales for a small coffee business. Because of this, I was forced to work longer hours, and pitch in on groceries and other basic supplies. These times have taught me how important family can be, and how things can change in an instant."

21,journal-entry-3908,This weeks pandemic journaling project asked about how COVID has impacted working for me in the past couple of months. Before COVID I had a part-time job at JC Penny in Brooklyn trying to save up some money for my freshman year of college. I initially generally worked around 4-5 hours 3-4 times out of the week but when COVID first started to hit in the US being only a part-time worker my hours started to decrease to almost none at all. Now when COVID became out of control in NYC everything closed down and with that my job was gone as well. By the time things finally started to reopen in the city my store was closing down with bankruptcy and they decided not to bring me back for the 2-3 months before they closed. The whole pandemic left me with about 4 months of not being to work or make money at all. 
22,journal-entry-3880,"The past week has been nothing but eye opening and inspirational for me as I have found ways to make myself happy as well as friends and family around me. I went to a Black Lives rally at Wright state listening to inspirational poems and speaker such as my brother who was there detailing what students like I should ask myself to excel in the present and in the future. If I am still able to get up eat, touch,taste,smell, laugh, joke and be happy then I'm great.Through times like these you have to satisfy yourself cause you'll never be happy or care to even participate in activities."
23,journal-entry-3868,"I graduated college during the Pandemic and my in person graduation was obviously cancelled. We got a super shitty graduation ""slide"" that we downloaded on our original graduation date. I thought I was over it, but I'm still mad about that.

This week I got an email where I could download my virtual diploma and I honestly felt so sad. Normally getting your diploma is a joyous occasion, but all it did was remind me that I didn't get to spend my last quarter with my friends. My last days of little responsiblities were ruined by a pandemic. We had so many plans for our last quarter together: traveling out of the country for the first time, camping, partying, going to the beach every single day, getting drunk on a boat, etc. Childish and stupid things, but after 4 years on focusing on school, working part-time jobs, and helping take care of my family I finally felt like I had some freedom. A bucket list of items to do before I started my next ""great"" stage of life. Now 6 months later, still in the middle of the pandemic, I'm bogged down by a shit ton of responsibilities. I moved across country, live alone, and started a grad program that I don't feel connected to. I'm forced to go to these zoom classes and participate when all I want to do is lay in bed and doing nothing. I'm feeling the loss of human connection now more than ever. I snapchat my friends and FaceTime my family daily, but I haven't talked in person to another human being (besides brief conversations with grocery store workers) in months.

The most frustrating thing is that there is no end in sight. Trump, the republican party, and mask deniers are ruining this country because they are not taking this pandemic seriously. It could be over, but their choices are affecting the lives of everyone in the US. So, now I just feel like time is passing by and I'm stuck. I'm stuck because I have to continue going to school and work like nothing has happened. I have to continue making decisions that will affect the rest of my life, but I can't even imagine what my future life looks like. We're all acting like life will go back to normal when this pandemic is over, but we don't even know if that will happen. So my mind and heart is stuck in February 2020 reminiscing about my life when I had freedom and about what could have been."
24,journal-entry-3861,"week of 8 October (Thurs) -- KEEPING COVID-19 RELATED PUBLIC ANXIETIES BOILING

FRUSTRATION: S. went back to the pool in Waltham, and saw 3 women outside talking agitatedly, and knew immediately that they too were upset at the failure of the pool to post when the youngsters teams would be using the pool and how long a spacing after they would not allow others to use the pool.

PLEASURE: We had a lovely garden gathering with A&R&D, welcoming A and daughter D to the US and coming out of their 14 day quarantine. They had been caught in Germany for months unable to travel to the U.S. although holding valid visas; and finally somehow finally got special permission to reunite with husband/father. The furniture from Germany arrived almost as quickly as they did, a surprise, apparently because there is so much unused capacity on the freight ships. My classes on zoom, and our Tuesday and Friday seminars continue to be engaging and two of the classes have the extra pleasure of being able to talk to people around the world. Also have been having some wonderful engagements on my Bacurau essay with my colleagues in Brazil (one by Face Time, the others by email), including today a Globo piece on the efforts by the American distributor to get the film into the Oscars -- a nice affirmation of my own sense of the film. Part of the essay is about COVID-19 in Brazil and connections with Black Lives Matter, and Indigenous Lives Matter.

DISTURBING ANXIETIES. Three notable and disturbing public events kept the country in turmoil this week:

(1) The President's COVID illness and wild erratic behavior. Admitting to COVID-19 symptoms beginning last Thursday (1 Oct), and being treated twice for alarming drops in blood oxygen levels, he was taken by helicopter to the Bethesda Naval Hospital (now known as Walter Reed, though somewhat distant from the historical Walter Reed campus) for 2 nights and his return to the White House after being infused with drugs both experimental and known to cause mania and mood swings, while claiming to be fine and it being a gift of God to have been able to lead the way in showing that COVID-19 can be cured, and showing off his ""cure"" by standing Mussolini like on the White House portico, taking off his mask, rigidly saluting, standing and visibly struggling for breath before heading inside without a mask, where he continued to infect anyone left inside. While at Walter Reed, he had himself paraded around in a black Secret Service car to wave at people and declare he felt younger and stronger than he had for twenty years (an effect of the steroids), waving like a caged king at his subjects. An anonymous irritated Secret Service person is reported to have comment that they signed up to take a bullet for the President, not to take one from him! Some thirty people of the President's staff and people attending tightly packed (no distancing, and no masks) events at the White House last week (e.g. the Rose Garden nomination of Amy Barret to the Supreme Court) have reported being infected, and the Mayor of Washington has urgently demanded meetings with the White House staff to arrange for contact tracing, which the White House so far has refused to pursue. Trump and/or the White House is being called a super spreader. In the following days after his return, his stream of (consciousness) tweets have become not only increasingly erratic, but alarming for national security (not only by having all the members of the Joint Chiefs being quarantined by COVID-19; but also by increasing his stoking of racist incitement to ""liberate Michigan"" and attacking Governor Gretchen Witmer and urging the state to ""open up""-- see item 3 below). These erratic tweets have included demanding that his government stop negotiating (""until after the elections"") with the Democratic leadership over desperately needed funds for people and small businesses struggling to find enough money for food, rent, and medicines; saying he would not participate in the second debate with Joe Biden unless the virtual town hall format (agreed to in June) was changed, and getting his doctor to issue a statement that he was well enough to return to public life; and to add insult to injury, he now blames Gold Star families (families of men and women in the armed forces who gave their lives in service to the country) of infecting him (they had been invited to the White House). Khizr Khan came on the Rachel Maddow Show and gave an extremely strong reprimand of Trump, Trump's ""mute enablers"", including for his doctors and spokespeople for claiming that Trump's medical records (including simply the date when he last tested negative) are ""private."" This is a violation of HIPPA rules that exclude privacy in the case of public health emergencies when information is needed for public health management. First son, Donald Trump Jr, headlined a rally today inside a closed hall where again people including himself refused to wear masks. The Commission of Presidential Debates cited the Trump family and supporters for arrogantly violating the rules of the Mayo Clinic and Case Western at the debate last week; enforced the placement, against the objection of the Pence team, of plexiglass partitions between the debaters at tonight's even (protective against direct particles but not more general aerosolization, but at least a partial precaution -- both Pence and Harris tested negative before the debate).

(2) The COVID-19 focused Vice-Presidential debate between Senator Kamala Harris and Vice-President Michael Pence plus a robot which settled in on his white hair and became among the most interesting of subjects of commentary of the evening. One cartoon had the fly parachuting in on a parachute labeled ""Joe Biden"". As likely is my fantasy that it was a robot-fly sent in from the White to sit on his head and monitor and control his patronizing, rude-interrupting, and trampling on the agreed rules of debate. In his male-dominance performance Pence is no match for the totally out of control, logorrheic, raging Trump, but is sufficiently blatantly offensive to draw attention to his rudeness, particularly in talking over Harris during her time to speak, and refusing to attend to the moderator's repeated admonishment that he was over time. However, purely on the battle of body language, Sen. Harris held her own and then some, by repeatedly admonishing him that she was speaking, and often giving him ""the look"" of mothers towards lying children; and by smiling broadly both at his silliness and in her own joy at being able to get her agenda across. The primary agenda on which she kept the debate focused was the pandemic, the 213,000+ lives lost and 7.64 million people who have become infected. And secondarily on the economic disaster Trump has brought about, particularly through the trade war with China, which she pointedly looking at Pence, ""you lost"". At his claim that NAFTA had been a disaster and the new trade deal has restored the economy, she pointed out the devastation in the manufacturing sector due to the China trade ""war"".

This was a debate, which Harris kept focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, on the lying and on the failures of the Trump Administration to be honest with the American people or to care much about deaths and infections. She also was strong on reminding people that the Affordable Care Act was under attack by the Trump administration, and is in the Supreme Court at the moment and will be in even greater danger should Amy Coney Barrett be confirmed, as would Roe v Wade. She was strong in reminding people of Trump's contempt for the veterans who have lost their lives (calling them losers and suckers). What she failed to do, in my view disappointing, was to prosecute Trump's (and his enablers, Attorney General Barr, Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and in fact all Republican senators) push into authoritarianism, the dismantling of the checks and balances in our system of government, the outright violations of his oath of office, the corruption of the cabinet, the effort to run the Administration with ""acting"" rather than Senate confirmed agency heads, and the effort to interfere with the Justice System. In response to Pence's charge that Democrats would pack the Supreme Court if Republicans make the court a 6-3 hard right wing court, she tried to remind voters of the Trump Administration's packing the Appeals Courts with right wing justices many of whom are declared by the ABA as incompetent and unqualified, and she gave a good for the moment of debate but eventually wrong history lesson to counter Pence's claim that in 29 cases of an election year Presidents in power always nominated. She used Lincoln's alleged restraint in not appointing someone until after the election, but both that Congress was in recess until December, so there was no point in announcing a nomination, and Lincoln was preoccupied in keeping his coalition together and so wanted to canvass opinion from around the country in the meantime, and although he disliked Salmon P Chase, he tempted him with the prospect of the appointment, and Chase then stumped for him during the election, and then after the election appointed him in the hope this would neutralize him within the Republican party (it didn't). Chase had been even more anti-slavery than Lincoln, and now replaced the deceased Chief Justice Roger Taney, who had authored the infamous Dred Scott decision with its lines that blacks were inferior and could never be American citizens.

Today, Mitch McConnell says publicly that he has not set foot in the White House since early August because he disagreed with how the White House was handling conditions there, and his concern for his own health. Commentators suggest he is trying to create some distance for other Republicans in tight Senate races to distance themselves from Trump. Although the races are all unnervingly tight, it does seem there is a chance for heavy Republican losses, and hopefully the loss of the Senate as well as the Presidency.

(3) Michigan Anti-COVID Precautions. The agitation against mask and social distancing, stirred up and abetted by Trump tweets, speeches, and interviews, and which today (8 October) exploded in the arrest and charging conspiracy and terrorism under both state and federal law of 13 men (who also had been in involved last April and May with storming the Michigan state legislature armed with guns during debates over Governor Witmer's request to extend ""stay-at-home"" order to slow the spread of the COVID-19. This time they were charged with planning to kidnap the Governor and try her for treason. Ironically, Michigan laws allow open and concealed carrying of guns, but not signs inside the Capitol."
25,journal-entry-3869,"I've been cooped up in my apartment alone for months. I only go outside for grocery shopping, doing the laundry, checking the mail, and taking out the trash. I'm trying to follow the rules, but what's frustrating is that other people are not putting in as much effort as me."
1,journal-entry-3881,"In the mist of this pandemic we are having a huge economic problem and I was suggested because I am in college right now to continue my education after I graduate and obtain my master's degree instead of looking for a job because the process of that would be long and there might not be a lot of work for me although I don't all the way agree with the fact that there would be work for me It would make sense to continue my education because I can focus on my work rather than the stress of finding a job, a place to stay and moving around the city."
2,journal-entry-3849,"It seems like the limitations of the pandemic are just normal now. My social activities are nonexistent, largely cause they involved seniors, all of whom are also in isolation. None of us are very daring about going to a restaurant even if the guidelines are kept. We’ve limited our contact to phone conversations or emails. Town activities at the senior center are all cancelled and I’m guessing it won’t open until there is an immunization.  I’m hoping that the senior center can offer Covid shots to those most at risk when it comes out.  I will only agree to the shot if it comes highly recommended by the scientific community and doctors, not at the recommendation of any politician, even one I voted for. "
3,journal-entry-3863,"My dad and my step mom run a dog boarding business in their home. Their business has taken a huge hit. I don't know the full extent because my dad tends to be cryptic about finances, but I know it's bad.

My mom and step dad retired and started collecting social security right before the pandemic hit. The timing couldn't have been better. My mom was a home health aid, and I can't imagine knowing she was at such high risk. My step dad was a manager at an auto parts store, and he has COPD. I worry all the time about how bad it would be if he got it. At least he's not working.

My brother already worked remotely before, but I know it was an adjustment to have his wife working from home, too.

One of my closest friends lost his job at an engraving shop--via text message, early in the pandemic. It's been hard on him not being able to find work in the area, feeling adrift.

Another close friend of mine lost her job at an architecture firm, due to lack of projects to bring in enough revenue to keep everyone.

Fellow grad students are especially grappling with lack of access to research materials (fortunately, most of my research is behind me), and remote teaching (I'm not teaching this year), but especially sobering is the uncertainty that international grad students are facing.

Many of my friends are young parents, and trying desperately to keep things on an even keel."
4,journal-entry-3862,"I can't believe how long this has gone on. It feels like it's been an eternity, but it simultaneously feels like it's been a lot less time than it has. I think it's because so many days are exactly the same. A couple of times when I was a young kid, I remember feeling disoriented after waking up from deep, dreamless sleep feeling like I closed my eyes a second ago. It feels like that. For months, I didn't think anything of all the thinkpieces and such saying, ""Stop waiting for life to go back to normal, because it never really will."" I didn't really believe that in March. Or April. Or May. Or June. Or July. Or August. Or even September. But I believe it now. It's difficult to accept, to get to that final stage of grief. Even after the pandemic is finally through, whenever that will be, I will never again live in a world that doesn't bear some of the social and political transformations of this year.

I'm so tired. I'm writing this at 3 AM because there's nothing that offers any escape. Watching a movie or reading a book just reminds me of the way things were, and may never be again. I have nowhere to physically escape to. And even when I do, reminders of the way things are are everywhere.

But I've been lucky. I'm a PhD candidate (which means all my coursework and exams are through, and I only have my dissertation to work on). I also work 20 hours a week at an intellectual job that I work from home. My income as a grad student has always made for a very tight budget, but I haven't lost my job. I'm not often in high-risk situations. No one I know has gotten sick. The pandemic has made me more appreciative of what I have.

But I live alone, and I'm single. I have pet birds I love dearly, but it's not the same as having someone to decompress with about all this. This stage of graduate school is a lonely one in normal circumstances, and it couldn't be lonelier now. At the end of the day either working or writing my dissertation, I don't have anyone or anything but the doom and gloom of current events. I see an endless stretch of an evening and don't know what to do with myself. I don't have the relief of coming home, where I've been all day. I drink more, because it tricks me into thinking I'm doing something fun where I'd be drinking. Sometimes I watch YouTube videos of places I've been with a drink in hand thinking I'll feel better, and I just feel worse.

I hate it. I hate all of this. I hate not knowing what kind of future comes after both the pandemic and the political turmoil. I hate that I'm supposed to just go about my work as if everything is totally normal when it's the least normal it's ever been, in my lifetime, anyway. Thinking about the job market after the PhD feels ridiculous. Not simply because there aren't any jobs, but because it calls for planning for some sort of normal future that I just don't know how to envision."
5,journal-entry-3865,"Just everything regarding the US election. 

There is so much riding on this. And in either case there will be fallout. I can feel the tension rising as November 3 comes closer. "
6,journal-entry-3826,"I wanted to marry my partner this year, after I found a new job. The pandemic has delayed both. I cannot get married to her because I would lose my health insurance, and because I do not have an income, it would be a strain for her to add me to her insurance. And her insurance through her work is bad anyway. the weekly mental health therapy I NEED to function properly would cost $80 a session so, f*ck that. So I think she and I will need to actually look for a different healthcare plan. I mean unless Universal Healthcare becomes a thing. That would be awesome."
7,journal-entry-3830,"In some ways yes--I have always trusted that God has a bigger purpose for this pandemic. At the end of the day, I know there is something good coming out of it and that God is in control. As much as people might deny God's sovereignty, we ARE leading up to the end times--whether its this year, or in a thousand years. Knowing that, and that God is in full control of what will happen in the end times, has been incredibly humbling and hope giving during the pandemic. I have had such moments of reverence and have learned to appreciate God and His glory in all circumstances. In the Bible, Paul writes that we should consider all suffering joy--and I do (or at least am working towards it, with the Holy Spirit). Jesus is good-He has saved me from an eating disorder, depression, and self-loathing. Despite the bleak circumstances and my own emotional and physical pain, and doubt, and failure to have faith, GOD is GOOD."
8,journal-entry-3839,"The other day I jumped in my friend's car and we drove 550 miles from suburban Maryland to her cabin in the mountains of Western North Carolina. It felt really great to get out of town--the leaves are starting to really turn now--bright crimson topped the trees and the highways were adorned by miles and miles of white Queen Anne's Lace and flaming yellow goldenrod and blue aster and it felt like a rainbow of colors everywhere, summer turning to autumn, the earth going about its business just fine. Walking around the back roads since getting here feels like another world too--not a soul in sight and no need to pull my mask out for hours, just breathing in crisp, cool mountain air. It's been good for the soul.

And yet, driving through Southern Virginia and Tennessee was a shock too--almost no one wearing a mask at the gas stations we stopped at, when in our area just outside Washington D.C most everyone wears a mask. It was like crossing over into another country. ""What part of this science do you not believe in"", I want to ask these people?

I feel like I am working so hard to stay sane and do my part to restore some normalcy to the U.S.--writing letters to people encouraging them to vote, training to work the polls because of the poll worker shortage. I am 58 and not at low risk, but at much lower risk than people in their 70s who usually staff the polls, and I am willing to take that chance to make sure EVERYONE can vote.

And yet, nothing feels like enough. Last night my dreams were crazy-anxiety- filled; over and over I kept arriving to large public gatherings with no one wearing a mask--not even me, and then I would wake up in a panic that I was nfected with COVID.

Watching Trump's latest shit-show this week--getting the virus, and then pretending it wasn't a big deal--never mind that he got the best medical treatment ANYONE in the world has gotten--makes me sick to my stomach. The sheer amount of lies he tells makes me sick. I think it's just too much cognitive dissonance to withstand--the narrative he creates versus the one we KNOW that we are all living, and he gets SO Much press and attention. I cannot wait for him to be gone and have someone in the White House who actually cares about the people he serves."
9,journal-entry-3843,"I'm working from home while also taking care of an 18 month old baby boy. My husband used to have the option of working from home, but is now expected to work in his office. He doesn't go into his office much, if at all, but he also doesn't help me take care of our son while we're both working from home.

It really pisses me off that he feels his work is more important than mine or that he doesn't have the option to take care of our son while he's working. It puts an extra burden on me because I don't have the option to mute my mic during my classes that I teach. I don't have the option to turn off my camera while teaching. Instead, I have to leave it on even when our child is feeling neglected and screams through half a class.

I have seen all of the articles and data about the lack of support from fathers in terms of equitable child rearing and how that affects mothers who work. I've discussed this with my husband and he says that because he started a new job in the middle of a pandemic that he doesn't have the flexibility to slack at work. However, I think it's unreasonable for any job to expect people, whether they have children or not, to be as productive as they were under ""normal"" circumstances."

11,journal-entry-3840,"Well, that's pretty obvious. On Friday, Trump tested positive for the virus, and now at least 19 people in his circle have too. The White House is not doing contact tracing, endangering people who live near those people exposed and people who live near me in the Washington DC area. Trump and his doctors lied about his condition, and he came back to White House while he was/is still contagious and took off his mask. He had a combination of drugs that NO ONE else in the US has had and then had the audacity to say the virus wasn't a big deal. We have a president now who is amped up on steroids and acting irrationally (even more so than usual) and the republicans act like this is normal. I can't even write about it anymore. It's literally making me sick to think about it. Counting the days now until the election and trying to stay hopeful that this nightmare will soon be over."

Hopefully, he will fully recover from COVID-19.

One thing that really bothers me, is when my friend who works at a local hospital told me she had a set up computer systems for people to work from home because a whole department had COVID-19. The Monday after the people were set to work from home, they all came back to work. One employee came to work shaking and wrapped It’s a blanket. Why would a hospital allow people who tested positive to come back to work? My friend said she didn’t know why but that department works in a separate building. It still doesn’t make sense because people from other departments do go into that building from time to time."

Bibi had prohibited demonstrations against him in Jerusalem, claiming that they spread the virus, so the protests moved to almost every community across the country. I live in Tel aviv, and since we are not allowed to go more than 1 kilometer from our house, there are protests across the city, multiplying like little Gremlins. We went out to demonstrate with our children and so did many of our friends. The demonstrations moved from Jerusalem and became a community event, and much bigger."

I've not seen messages or memes about the COVID pandemic that seem racist or offensive, but I am glad that conversations about racism are happening. Awareness is being heightened (once again) about racial disparities whether regarding health care, educational opportunities or economic challenges. It's right that these conversations are happening.

I've chosen books like 'Caste' and 'White Fragility' to help me gain a better understanding; I've engaged in conversations about the topic; I search for ways to be of support for those in need. May conversations move - albeit slowly - toward actions that foster equality."
15,journal-entry-3792,"Without question, Donald Trump getting Covid--a needed reminder that the powerful are mere mortals. Unfortunately, the lesson has not taken hold with DT himself, who had a mild enough case (plus treatment most people don't have access to) that he's acting like it was no big deal, and going back to the same sort of in-person activities that have gotten so many other people infected along with him."
16,journal-entry-3811,"Living in a country where people don't have to worry about the financial burden of being sick, I have become even more committed than before to the belief that society should provide universal health care as a basic right. We went through a bad case of Covid in our home, including hospitalization and a long (still ongoing) recovery process. I cannot imagine how much more stressful this whole experience would be if we had to simultaneously worry about how we could pay for everything. We are indeed privileged even so because we have the means to pay for a private supplemental insurance on top of the social security coverage, but in this case everything has actually been covered by the basic insurance: doctor visits, medical scans, hospitalization and all treatments, medicines... So my views haven't changed all that much, but I have reaffirmed the beliefs that guide my political actions."
17,journal-entry-3820,Unfortunately - the pandemic has affected my political views - this is so sad. I have tried so hard to not politicize following medical/scientific precautions and treatment. However - the current leader of our country has made this virtually impossible. The good news is that I have been so aware of my bias against people who appear to not be following these most basic precautions that it has made me look further into my own personal political beliefs and those of the presidential candidates that are currently running. The pandemic has actually reinvigorated my passion for the importance of learning what candidates stand for and the effect of your vote to the overall state of things in the United States. The polarizing effects of the current political climate are unbelievable - friends of mine who have never discussed political topics are actually debating and sharing. I know this should be good but I find myself questioning my friends and their different beliefs. I think it's interesting about how much of this has to do with current presidential nominees vs. how much is pandemic and how people are dealing with this. The issues are so intertwined and it just shouldn't be like that.

Esos momentos son los que más atesoro: me gusta sentarme sola, con calma, con un libro o con una libreta, observar a la gente, y leer o escribir. Casi 7 meses sin poder hacerlo.

Logré ubicarme en una mesa casi completamente aislada del resto. Estar ahí unos 20 minutos. Fue un regalo para mi vida. Me puse a hojear unas libretas que había comprado, así como una agenda rebajada. Es tonto, pero con todo lo que ha pasado en este año, no quería invertir en una agenda 2021 personalizada o especial. Es como una rebeldía que experimento. Siento que todas mis esperanzas para este año fueron defraudadas y, de berrinche, no voy a invertir en una agenda especial. Así que compré una en rebaja.

No había mucha gente para observar porque se guardan estrictas medidas para que el aforo de los establecimientos se cumpla con pocas personas. Además, sugieren que la estadía en el establecimiento no se alargue más de 30 minutos. Y hay que añadir: sentía un pequeño desasosiego debido al miedo latente de infectarme por quedarme mucho tiempo allí.

Al salir, un muchacho muy joven interrogaba a otro muchacho igual de joven del establecimiento sobre la posibilidad de optar a un empleo en el lugar. El joven le indicaba dónde debía llenar la solicitud de empleo. Se me comprimió el corazón. Todos estamos en una situación difícil, pero me conmovió la franqueza y necesidad de empleo de aquel muchacho. La verdad es esta: nos está llevando la chingada. Solamente esos pequeños detalles de la vida: poder comprar un café y saborearlo unos minutos en calma, nos salvan de los vientos atroces."

21,journal-entry-3714,"This past week was wonderful and strange - my husband and I moved into our first house together. We both took the week off from work to move and unpack and get settled in. Buying a house during the pandemic was certainly a challenge on top of all of the normal home-buying challenges. Plus, because of the pandemic, house sales have gone up, and so we paid a lot for this house, to the extent we are expecting the value to be drastically less in a year or two. But, also because of the pandemic, mortgage rates are really low, so we were able to get a very low interest rate.

One of the most stressful parts for me with this experience was that we had to have a few different people (i.e. locksmith, HVAC, movers, etc.) come over to do some things to the house right away. So, anytime we contacted companies/individuals to see if they could do work to our house, we had to ask what precautions they take (i.e. wearing a mask). We were very pleased that anyone coming into our home to do work was very good about wearing a mask while they were in our home. It was just another layer to an already long, drawn-out process."

The feeling of insecurity to even get tasted, is almost out of the book. The personal information such as your address is a big deal during the presidency of Trump. Mental health struggle, and finance, has driven me off the wall. There is no weekly unemployment check for immigrants that did not have work permit. Although, there is foods that are been distributed in the community for those that are struggle and need something to eat, those meals cannot feed entire family, and keep them health.  In ... class, we are learning about the effect of nature and nurture in person's health. This Covid19 has expose significant affect of these in poor communities.  There is even greater correlation to ""Poverty Poison the Brain"". Those foods are not the same as wealthy people ate.

He let the nation down, by not taken adequate action, and using his presidential authority wisely to contain this virus without taken beloved Americans lives. Leaders suppose to be our guidance, stars, and protectors. However, Trump failed to do that. Instead, he spread fear, violence, and division among the Americans. Perhaps, you are wondering if this has any personal affect on me. Indeed, with the high level of unusual anxiety, seen the President of this great nation, is not qualified for his job, is absolutely terrifying.

25,journal-entry-3679,"What has changed the most about the world since the coronavirus began is how we greet each other. Usually when you meet someone new you shake their hand, but now that personal connection when you first meet someone is gone. The CDC originally suggested elbow bumps instead of handshakes, but now greetings all together are not acceptable. Adding in an additional six feet of distance between you and another person into the mix also makes sure that no greetings are taking place. Social distancing and mask wearing makes it hard to read expressions on someone's face, which is a crucial part of interacting with someone new. Also, masks prevent people from being able to read lips, which makes it difficult for those who are hard of hearing to follow a conversation and contribute their own thoughts to one. Social interaction is also crucial to babies who were just born. Children born during the pandemic are missing out on these important first developmental steps. As we must continue with these protocols to ensure the safety of our community and slow the spread of the coronavirus, it is crazy to see just how many groups of people are affected in different ways and how these changes are quite significant.

These new social measures will have a lasting impact on society, as it will be a slow transition back to large gatherings, handshakes, and mask free events. It will be interesting to see if people will ever feel comfortable standing within a close proximity to strangers and if mask-wearing when you are sick will become normalized. Although many aspects of the world has changed since the pandemic first started, I believe the social aspect of our world will be the most impacted."

I also found myself feeling very angry and helpless about the situation and very very worried about what lies ahead in this country."
7,journal-entry-3609,"At this point it's sort of hard to tell, because a lot of the changes have become so normalized. I think something that has changed about the world fundamentally is the way in which we view and react to perceived safety in public spaces. I think everyone has a conception of how 'clean' or 'dirty' a public space is, ('cleaner' places being a public park, 'dirtier' being the airport or the grocery store) but in the pandemic we've reconceptualized 'cleanness' into more human terms.

What's deemed as clean or safe is now determined upon the number of people in a place and their potential for coronavirus contacts, not necessarily how sticky the floor is or how grungy the walls may look. With this recontexualized idea of safety, I feel like after the brunt of the pandemic is over, people will still continue to change their behaviors to reflect this perceived safety, namely by continuing to wear masks in places deemed 'dirty' (full of people).

I've been watching videos of people in airports and on planes for example, and even though the footage is from pre-pandemic times, I still can't believe that people weren't wearing masks in such crowded, dirty places. I think starting now, people will be wearing masks in places like airports, or even crowded public transit, now that we have an idea of how quickly pathogens can spread in those congested environments."

Last night, I also had a really tough conversation where one of my peers (I wouldn't exactly call him a friend, yet) bascially told me about how lonely and homesick he is on campus, that he would just cry every day for the first few weeks of school, that he hates it on campus and doesn't leave his room if possible, etc. My heart just hurt for him and I wish I knew what I could do to make it better.

En los departamentos, muchas personas claman por continuar la actividad económica porque es imposible vivir de ahorros que no existen.

A esto se debe agregar que los servicios de salud que son los que pueden ""registrar"" las tasas sobre la enfermedad, en mi país, están concentrados en la ciudad y, muy pocos en las zonas metropolitanas de los departamentos. Esto influye en que las personas enfermen y no asistan a un centro de salud u hospital, se curen o mueran en sus casas. El subregistro aumenta de esa forma o es inexistente.

Además, últimamente, se ha escuchado que las personas prefieren pasar la enfermedad en sus hogares y no asistir a los hospitales porque se sabe que están saturados o que la atención puede ser realmente mala.

Omg sounds like covid can actually cause Parkinson's disease

Also one of the last few days the US crossed 200,000 deaths and it leaves me a bit numb

Horrible pain started during a Zoom call with D, I was sobbing saying ""we won't let them get away with this!"", and ended up unable to breathe.

Slept ok actually but awful pain, moving very slowly with my cane

Puts me in a great mood to see 45 get booed and chanted at (while ""paying respects"" to RBG in DC), ""vote him out!"" ""Honor her wish!"" We will not let him get away with this. We will not. We're not dead yet.

Yesterday shopping trip means we have bananas, which I haven't had in months, and yogurt! Luxuries! I love having bananas.

S said this morning, ""right after our shopping trip it's hard to balance things in the refrigerator getting them out to make my lunch  -- I know it's a first world problem."" And I said, ""it is a luxury problem compared to many people for sure, but 'i can only get food every 3 weeks and then it barely fits in my little refrigerator' is not actually the definition of a first world problem!""

Nice talk with my aunt in Canada. Her entire region has fewer than 1000 total cases of covid so far, whereas my county alone has 20,000 so far, so we just don't agree on how dangerous it is for her to go into a restaurant -- she ""just wanted to sit at the usual table"" inside so she did.

B, a close friend in the past, and her family have covid in Israel. She says she is really tired and had to be briefly hospitalized but seems otherwise to be not having severe symptoms so far, and also all her healthcare has been free, which is just mind-blowing compared to the US. They're about to enter a 3-week lockdown. I really envy her being with her sister's family and her parents there. We can't leave the country because I can't travel due to my injury and I really wish we could because it's really getting frightening here, feels like 1930s Germany to me, with Trump making pronouncements about continuing his rule, white genes being ""good genes,"" and depriving certain cities of federal money.

We subscribe monthly to a lot of essential items to be delivered from Amazon, did even before covid because it's hard for me to shop, and the upcoming delivery shows 3 of our items temporarily unavailable, which is unusual and makes me worry that supply chain issues are coming in a severe way.

One of the stranger Yom Kippurs of my life. We used Zoom for all the services so I found myself drifting off into email, Facebook, etc. It was horribly hot. We had a really excellent long conversation about Paul Berman's Tablet piece on liberalism and the Harper's letter about free debate. Maybe the high point was half an hour of virtual shmira (watching over the body) for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. We read and sang psalms and then read from her Supreme Court decisions and cried.

Neilah was so short and kind of nothing. It was very moving to have S blow shofar at the end and we both cried as we clung to each other, S saying ""I'm so scared!""

At least I didn't have to go in person to services with my reclining wheelchair which is so painful.

This shift has led to a large remodeling in how I interact with the outside world in a few senses. First and foremost it has changed the way I connect with my friends and loved ones; as some one who is very into cooking, Covid completely derailed my ability to show love through making my friends meals and baked goods. Over the course of these last few months I have had to look into different ways of spreading love that wasn't in the form of giving physical objects, which honestly has been an interesting but helpful process for me. Secondly, it redefined just what a quick trip to a store or shop entailed. Going into these establishments, browsing suddenly became a foreign concept- now when I go, I picked up only the items I need and strayed from touching anything I was not 100% going to buy. Even after that, the items bought have to be quickly sanitized and washed upon their return from the store, making any small purchase into a much larger process. Finally, not being able to touch objects without stress has changed the way I interact with strangers. No longer feeling able to throw a kids frisbee back when it lands near me with out feeling like I could have oversteps some ones comfort zone, or pick up something some one dropped has truly shifted the way interact with the outside world."

We have friends come and sit in the garden six feet apart, offer water and nuts, but no sharing of food -- one group of all elders who have been meeting monthly and before the pandemic it was potluck dinner. TEACHING & WORK. Zoom meetings have some great advantages of seeing people from around the world, so some seminars are extraordinarily enriched. Two of my classes are intense graduate seminars (with a few undergrads) and these are enriched by people coming in from all over the world. The one intensive undergraduate class is minutely timed by my co-faculty and it is an enormous amount of backstage work and coordination, particularly at the beginning when we took seriously all the guidelines beginning with such admonitions that students attention span is (of course there is 'scientific data') only 1.5-2 minutes and videos should be made but not longer than 5 or 10 minutes at most. This proves to be just silly -- the students are engaged and attentive, ask questions, answer them. There are small break out rooms for short exercises -- this helps get to know them and to bond. Some 40 students total divided into four groups. DEATHS. Deeply mourning and grieving the death of RBG, but also at the same time a close philosopher friend, a less close but anthropologist friend, a few weeks ago close literature scholar friend, and a few weeks earlier a member of the Staying Put group of elders who meet monthly. Of these, he was one of the first to die of COVID-19 from our circle of closer friends, and one of the first to suddenly die from one day to the next in the nursing home that shortly experienced almost 100% of the residents infected, a high profile case of a high end care facility which was not spared. We did a shiva for his widow standing on the sidewalk outside her house, and only five people were allowed to accompany him to be buried; there was then a zoom shiva with relatives who from around the country. The deaths of George Floyd, Breona Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tamir Rice, Treyvon Martin, Eric Garner, Rayshard Brooks, Botham Jean, Daniel Prude, Freddie Grey, Alton Sterling -- many now recorded on video, puts structural racism and police violence on the agenda and contributes to a general state of rage and anxiety compounded by:

ANXIETY. The whole country is in a state of nervous breakdown in part through the criminal and negligent dismantling of pandemic preparedness infrastructure and a racist President and police departments that seem intent on restoring Jim Crow white supremacy in the nation, and in part through the violation of laws and constitutional obligations by the President, facilitated by his cabinet, Republican senators who refuse to curb him in any way, and a raft of ""acting appointees"" running agencies of the government to avoid vetting and Senate confirmation. This is not only Jim Crow racism, but also capitalist greed, and a total lack of any sense of public obligation or service on the part of so many of those who have become rich, and deny even basic relief for those who have lost their jobs and health care thanks to the pandemic. Everyone on all sides is agitated by the upcoming Presidential election thanks to the President and Republican Governors open effort to suppress voting, the packing of the courts with right wing judges (and the coming effort to appoint a right wing Supreme Court justice to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, tilting the court 6-3 to the right), and the President's open refusal to legitimize the election process, already saying that he will only accept the election results if he wins, and, worse, today saying in answer to a reporter's question if he will ensure a peaceful and smooth transition in the elections saying that there should be no need for any transition, the votes should be dispensed with, and continuity will reign; he has also made rally speeches about his desire for an unconstitutional third term or more. We are watching the destruction of democracy in slow motion, that the system of democratic checks and balances we have long prided ourselves on be allowed to be destroyed. We seem to be learning that our system depended on norms of civility and good will rather than a strong institutional structure of enforceable law. We may well survive if the elections bring a Democratic Senate as well as a Democratic President, to begin to rebuild; but no one seems confident of such an outcome, and the voices of the gun-toting rabble and informal militias grow louder. To make things even worse, much of the world seems to be following suit in the polarization between populist-nationalist forces and international cooperation and interdependence. With the acceleration of climate change migration, and ecological destruction, the pressures will only intensify. FASCINATION: We cannot stop watching the video footage of all the above. We take hope where we can, above all in the incredible democratic moblizations of marches in the streets led by Black Lives Matter, My Brothers Keeper and other organizations (the hard organizing work getting less attention than it deserves, not least because if there was more attention people would feel more hope and join in more easily). We contribute money, write postcards to voters to reassure them that their votes will be counted, do phone banking, plant signs -- but it all seems too little.

ACADEMIC & COMMITMENT: Zoom meetings on the technical biology and the policy-politics of COVID-19 provide some sense of stability, that we are making some progress in unpacking the virus and its effects on the body (endothelial cells, damage to the heart, not just respiratory and the lungs as stressed earlier) and the terrible and largely still puzzling effects suffered by the ""long haulers"" (those who allegedly come out of severe infection, but suffer severe debilitation for months after), and the dynamics of infection and shedding by asymptomatic carriers; and some better understanding of the rearrangements of habitats that cause the spilling over"" of the virus into human populations; and even more so that contact tracing and other ""public health efforts"" (when not disabled by the CDC and FDA under pressure from the White House) are revealing the social components of pandemics being the most important predictors of who lives and who dies. In the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Paul Farmer reminded us in a seminar to day, key drivers of the epidemic were the care-takers and the people who had to bury the dead. We too in the more affluent world have lost all too many of our most courageous physicians, nurses, hospital staff, and other care-givers. Among the points of hope are where things have gone well: the preparedness of Uganda and other less affluent countries, the role that care-taking as well as contact tracing plays (checking in repeatedly, helping arranged daily needs, be it food or child care or translating), the commitment of places like Singapore to provide monetary relief for people being unable to work as well as to commit to more rapid diagnostics development.

TODAY the sun was out, and we count our blessings."
1,journal-entry-3371,"This is the time of the Jewish holidays. The time of long hours in synagogue. The time of certain songs and tunes that, at least for me, make up the day. The time of gathering with friends and family. The time of communal rituals, and even dancing.

And all that is not allowed.

I can't get a ticket to shul - and even if I did, the service is shortened; there is not singing; there is not mingling.

I sit and pray on my own.  And due to the rules, I can't even have more than 5 people sit with me in my garden.

I heard the shofar in the backyard.

I won't get to dance with a Torah on Simchat Torah. I won't march with others for Hoshanot throughout Sukkot. I won't sit in the sukkah with friends. There are not group meals.

Yom Kippur I will be fasting and being on my own. Somehow I am to make a Yizkor service three times, for no more than 5 people at a time. Create that sense of communal mourning as we are not really a number of a community.

It is Tishrei. It is the time of all the holidays. Just everything feels likes it's in the individual instead of the community."

El poder salir y trabajar en algo me ayuda muchísimo a distenderme. Puedo trabajar y pensar en lo que se me de la gana, parece mentira pero el cambio de ambiente me ayuda a hacer volver mi creatividad y mis ganas de hacer algo que involucre mis pasiones, cosas que el encierro y la rutina apagan lentamente sin notarlo."
3,journal-entry-3366,"Life is kind of difficult right now. My partner and I are both immunocompromised; I am on chemotherapy drugs and she has an autoimmune disease. So we have tried to avoid leaving the house as much as we can. But even when we have to go to essential places, like doctors or shopping, it is terrifying for us. We live in Oklahoma, and it seems like no one here cares to wear a mask or stay away from us. I am blind and have a guide dog, so before COVID, people used to randomly come up to pet him (which was really annoying in its own way), but at least that has stopped a bit. This pandemic has been very isolating for us. We dont have a car, which is a pretty tough way to live in Oklahoma. So I have to rely on my mother, who comes in contact with other people (usually with her mask, but I am never fully sure) to take me to get my meds or to my doctors appointments (which there is a lot of, cancer during a pandemic is not very fun). I feel like I am drowning in bad news all the time; getting on twitter is exhausting now. I feel like this country is falling apart at the seams. Every news story I see is of increasing COVID deaths, cops killing people for no reason, death, death, death. I mean, I am an Indigenous queer woman; I understand that this country was trash to begin with, I have lost family to cop violence and white violence against Native women, so I guess I am used to the death. But it feels like all of this death is building up around me, and I am scared. I am not really scared to die, but I am scared to experience the death of people I love. I have had enough of that in my life, I don't know how I would mentally handle anymore. All of my friends are long distance now. One of my best friends is literally my neighbor but I havent seen her since April; she works at the library on campus and it's not safe for me and my partner. She constantly tells me that people break the mask rule at work and that no one really understands what 6 feet apart actually means. One of my friends is in New York, which was really scary because he flew down here the week our college cancelled classes in March, when the highest COVID cases were in NY, but he had planned this trip for over 6 months and didn't live in the city, so we figured it would be okay. He said that he was the only person on the plane to Oklahoma, and there was only 2 people on the plane back to New York. The state of Oklahoma and the US government obviously dont care about use, but I do feel like my tribe is trying. They have ... my hometown, practically on lockdown: there has been a consistent mask mandate all over the city since April, and they are giving free testing to non tribe members, as well as delivering and distributing PPE all over the state. My people have my back, they even share meme like photos of our past chiefs and warriors in masks, encouraging everyone to wear them. Anyway, I am writing this the night of Trump admitting he wont peacefully transfer power over if Biden winds and the day that Breona Taylor's murderers got away with it, so I am pretty scared for the next couple of months."
4,journal-entry-3364,"This week has felt better than most. I was able to connect with people back at home in a way I feel I haven't been able to in months. My best friend and my mother experienced another year of life, and we celebrated that together. This week gave me hope; it reminded me that there will be plenty of times where we aren't dealing with this bullshit. Once this passes, I'll be able to connect more with those around me, and this will only be a memory. Not related to COVID, I've felt happier. This week I've managed to find a flow within this day-by-day schedule that I've struggled to find before. Its a little disheartening to say that I'm growing used to COVID, yet it's easier to adapt and survive than it is to sulk about it."
5,journal-entry-3361,"I'm really upset that the Pandemic Journaling Project would feature an entry from someone who believes the pandemic is a hoax and that it will go away after the election.

It's not up for discussion. It's like saying the sky is yellow or we breathe sulfur dioxide. Those are both false statements and you wouldn't give them credence. Why give credibility to someone who doesn't believe in the pandemic? It's not a debatable issue, even though people would like it to be for political reasons.

Featuring this person's entry just gives credibility to the alternative universe that Trump has created from lies. 22,000 of them in four years.

Last fall, I started a new job, which had it's own stresses, but was less work than getting my degree. I was looking forward to settling into the new job, meeting new friends, and exploring new responsibilities. Then, COVID hit. All of a sudden I was trapped again. Not able to do what I wanted to do. Not able to meet my new friends and explore the new parts of my job. I'm just trying to make it through each semester just like I did when I was finishing my degree. I feel cheated out of the life I glimpsed last fall."

It is a really sad and hard thing to think about but the reality is that this virus has had an impact on everyone one way or another. All of my friends got sent back home because the campus needed to close down. They did not have time to take everything and many of them didn't know where to go because they lived very far away. Something else was that some parents lost their jobs. Others needed help to get supplies like food, water or toiletries. I know that in the news they talked about people not having enough money to pay the bills. All of these things definitely impacted the way they had to change lifestyles."

Some changes that have occurred include going to school online and less work during the summer because most of my events I attend were closed. I have not really participated in the pandemic because I believe that it is irrelevant. To me this is all a scam by the democrats because they do not want trump to be re-elected. I have not worn a mask unless I have been made to. they are uncomfortable and pointless if you ask me. I feel like this corona vires is nothing more than like the flu or strep. at the beginning of the summer my mom had it and she was just fine.

It makes me angry they could put up scientifically unsound information that could endanger more lives than already.

12,journal-entry-3183,"The summer has come to an end as the leaves begin to fall, and as the weather starts to become colder across the USA, we are entering a new chapter of human existence. The change in the seasons and the new school year has brought a new set of emotions and environments for many people worldwide. Many of us have seen more people in the last month than in the previous six months, meaning that interacting with other students and teachers can seem foreign, after many months of only seeing your friends or teachers over zoom.

For me, this last month has been uniquely tricky compared to the (equally or more complicated) months of quarantine, as I became less accustomed to handling a large workload and have experienced social anxiety. I frequently ask myself questions such as, “how has social distancing made it harder to make true friendships?” “am I learning enough?” “am I trying hard enough” and “how do I care for my mental health and keep up my grades?”. All these questions tie broadly into something that arose in a new environment: the unknown we have to become accustomed to. I see myself completely unsure about my future and the present moment, unlike ever before, due to the many factors of not complete experience in college and the future. It feels as if I am back in school and not at the same time perceiving I am not getting the “full” experience of college I expected to get, but being grateful to what I am given. Once I question my surroundings and see how “different” I am experiencing my life than ever before, I know the importance of embracing what we don’t know and following my intuitions."
13,journal-entry-3191,I have had primarily very positive expereiences with people supporting each other during COVID. I feel strongly that if you give off a 'positive vibe' that you generally get 'positive vibes' back. Every once in a while I know this doesn't work but in general I think it does. I am part of a neighborhood watch program that went virtual during the pandemic and this 'blog' has proven some of the amazing things that people do to support each other. This includes going to grocery stores for elderly/at risk community members. TAking people to Dr. Appointments etc. I also am blessed to be part of a church community that has been very supportive. My daughters are part of the medical field and have personally received great thanks and lots of food for all their work.
14,journal-entry-2730,"I think of what's happened with my sister-in-law. She's from a different economic background from my immediate family. Although we are all high risk, being Black, and some of us are obese, or even have chronic conditions, there are big differences. Our family is mostly upper middle class. Her family has not yet reached that stage. Our family has stayed home, some of us working from home, and we have been well. In her family, both her mother, and her mother's husband got COVID-19 from a health rehabilitation facility. I watched her deal with all of the stories I'd been hearing about on the news. She could not visit her relatives. As they were quite sick, it was hard to get information on their treatment plans or prognosis. Thankfully, her mother recovered. Her husband had many more health issues, and died. I was overwhelmed as I watched her family say goodbye to him while he was on a ventilator, and probably not responsive. His son had to say goodbye to his father using Facetime on a cell phone. It was heartbreaking.

My sister-in-law was also the only person in our family to get furloughed, then laid off from their job due to the pandemic. So recognizing that there is a heavy racial element to outcomes during this time, it's also quite evident how classism or education and wealth play roles in our social constructs. I recognize the good fortune that our lifestyle has provided myself and my immediate family. But I get angry when I see how badly people fare in the same country when they have just a few less resources. And it makes me grieve for the ""greatest country on earth"" because I can plainly see that we've been lying to ourselves, and in so many ways the US is in much worse shape than many 2nd and 3rd world countries."

Instead, thinking about senior activities that will be missed due to the pandemic. As the time goes by, more positive cases are coming out, it came clear that non of the senior activities will take place, even our graduation will be online. I was frustrated, furious and selfish. Because, I am the first person in my family to be attending college, and to make them proud of my accomplished, and graduating as second in my class with speech, I wanted them to watch me on stage. After awhile, I then realized that, the healthy of the nation, is far more important than any individualism. As a result, I put my personal feelings on side, and started to care about others.

This meant a loss of income for me and many other students who were forced to move out. Now, many students have virtual jobs and are able to make an income, but that loss has troubled many students and families that rely on student incomes.

Cabe mencionar que teníamos que juntar en plena llovizna, con barro y frío,  yo sabía que me iba a enfermar en esas condiciones y enferma no me iban a dejar entrar al galpón por reglamento sanitario así que dije ""no, prefiero seguir en el galpón"" y no volvieron a llamarme.

De hecho, ese día que algunos sí fueron a juntar, una chica se lastimó por las condiciones que ya mencioné, pidió pasar su lesión por la ART; la pasaron, pero a ella y las demás personas que fueron enviadas (empleados enviados por el sindicato rural) también dejaron de ser llamados. Al final, el problema no era la pandemia, es el imbécil del encargado de planta que te llama y te corre del trabajo cuando quiere, porque pedir pasar una lesión es un derecho, elegir una respuesta también, si no quería respuestas negativas o empleados heridos lo hubiera dicho y el sindicato rural tal vez le conseguía robots sin derechos humanos.

First two days virtual were ok, and better than expected. The first few hours had me rethinking the whole process and wanting hire a homeschool teacher. Links wouldn't work, and it was hard to hear sometimes. That being said the teachers and students were pretty amazing. Patient, flexible, kind. So grateful for that. Second day was much better.

6,journal-entry-2915,"Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to journal about the pandemic as much as I originally thought I might. This is because my anxiety is so prevalent that I have needed to start avoiding thinking about COVID and its many, devastating effects as much as possible.

This week is particularly difficult because my fiancé began to teach in-person at two schools. He teaches over 100 students who have opted for in-person instruction per day at two schools. He is working in buildings that have thousands of students and staff. There have already been positive cases confirmed at both schools, but we have been told that the schools will not close for positive cases.

My fiancé and I had a serious conversation about if this job—one that my fiancé can picture himself in for the rest of his career—is worth the risk. In tears, we agreed that it was not. But we cannot afford for him to resign.

I could go on at length about my fears, such as how many students attended Labor Day gatherings the day before showing up to my fiancé’s classroom, unaware that they are spreading the virus to their friends and teachers or how the school district is failing its students and staff through its half-measures, ill-preparedness, and general lack of solutions that are real and not erected for the sole purpose of protecting the district in a legal battle.

But the main purpose of my journal today is to write down my feelings of helplessness and insignificance. My fiancé and I are doing everything within our power to lower our risk of contracting COVID, but it isn’t enough. We are not safe. We are helpless to properly defend ourselves against an invisible virus that doesn’t discriminate. This is mainly due to the school district’s negligence.

Maybe we’ll be the lucky ones. At this point, it’s up to chance to decide our fate.

Perhaps the hardest part about all of this is that if we are seriously impacted by COVID, it won’t even matter. If either or both of us are out of work for weeks or months, develop serious complications or health conditions, rack up thousands of dollars in medical debt, have irreparable damage done to our bodies, or, yes, die, our lives will change or end forever, but the masses will go on unscathed.

We will become nothing but a tiny blip in the many statistics. The privileged ones won’t bear our struggles. They will continue on, unchanged and unmoved, by human suffering."

We had a magical Labor Day. After sun and surf&enjoying an active day we gathered driftwood and had a fire on the beach after dark. Primal we were joined by friends who are here every year. We we’re distanced but enjoyed a wonderful night. They brought wine and beer. We had fireworks-heavy duty fireworks. They were spectacular.

It makes me extremely angry when so-called friends who know damn well that I have to lead an especially restricted life for medical reasons, literally brag about visiting friends and relatives and eating in restaurants and going into stores. Why do these people behave like that? The two friends I am thinking about are very self-absorbed, entitled people. Maybe they'll be on a ventilator someday soon.

12,journal-entry-2902,"I""m not sure if 21 counts as a child, probably not, but the 21-year old I'm writing about is my son, so he will always be ""my child!""

All week I've been so conscious of how much gratitude I have for the little gift that the pandemic has brought me--an extra five months with my son. He is at the age when kids are generally moving out of the house or off to college, but he decided to take a semester off and stay home for a job, internship and two remote classes. Usually when he's at school, we text or talk on occasion, but he's pretty private and it's hard to get details from him about his life, classes, etc. because he's so busy. Then when he's home, he's out a lot seeing his friends.

But now that he's living at home, we talk every day. He fills his dad and me in on his job, his internship, what he's working on in class. Because we have time together, I think he feels more comfortable telling me things.

I'm delighted that I get to be his mom again, and that we have this time together to learn how to have an adult relationship,  rather than just on his school breaks.

I am even getting to watch my son mature close up, at home, in a way that would not have been probable under most other circumstances. He chose to stay home, so he is not resentful toward us, in any way. He knows that he is really lucky he has a part time job AND a great internship and he is grateful for this. He's interested in learning life skills that he didn't quite pick up before he left for school (e.g. Cooking, Barbecuing, sewing, fabric dying) and I am having fun teaching him! He's actually cleaning up after himself and doing most of his own cooking and shopping. I think he appreciates that he has two parents who love and support him and are making/keeping a home for him where he can be safe.

So, to answer the question: the pandemic has forced him to grow up a little faster than he would have otherwise, and he has taken on this challenge magnificently by being proactive and going forward with his life. He has made exquisite lemonade out of lemons, and I am so proud of him"
13,journal-entry-2909,"I had one friend who had to actually quarantine himself because he had caught the virus and honestly I was frightened for him. When you hear that someone close to you has the virus the only thing to think is that ""Oh will he/she make it"" so I asked my friend immediately what I could do to be of help while he was healing. However, he was calm and took the process of healing slowly and so I did the same but the only restriction that really caused any frustration was the fact that we weren't allowed to go to many places although it was completely understandable why the government issued a lock down."

The way America has handled the lockdown is horrifying. By definition public health is never a matter of individual rights. It is one thing to have free choice of action if the only person included in the consequences is yourself. It is a total other ballgame if your choice not to wear a mask etc could lead to the deaths of many others. Right now in the news is the Maine wedding case. I think I heard that none of the people who died from the web of cases connected to the wedding guests meeting actually attended the wedding themselves.

I am personally one of those people that will go out of my way to protect others, and even though that extreme is not healthy either, outright refusal to help others astounds me. 

And that is not entirely different from our lives before Covid-19. But this global catastrophe is showing how poorly prepared the US was because the US isn't built on helping others. That isn't the mentality we have. The American Dream and the theme of pulling yourself up, climbing the ladder to success, are actively dying, faster now than it had been before Covid-19. 

How long is this society going to hold on to the old ways? Will we finally change? Will the change come in time to prevent other horrific global catastrophes? Because just because the world had halted somewhat do to the pandemic, we still have a ""Big Bad"" global climate change to resolve. Otherwise, we will be permanently altering the climate of the world in a way that will make it horrifically difficult for life to live here. 

THAT is horrific. This pandemic feels like we are now at square 1 regarding how to resolve the other existential threat we face. It just makes me honestly panic. Because we are so busy with trying to fix the short term problem, since we were not prepared in the first place, we will be too late to fix the end of life on Earth. "

20,journal-entry-2681,"The biggest obstacle that I faced this week is drama in my work life. The local restaurants are full of drama queens and divas. Just to up the ante, my latest workplace is a new restaurant inside a convenience store. The pandemic has filled the workforce with qualified applicants, so we can all be replaced easily. Sometimes, none of us has a clue about how to handle work issues. As we all train and introduce more food offerings to the public, more people show up. And introducing new foods has not been easy. Supplies that are short in the grocery stores are also short in the restaurant supply houses. The new business has not been affected by the pandemic. That last fact should be good news for the convenience store chain, as they are counting on the fact that they offer food as well as alcoholic beverages to save them from closures due to the pandemic. It is a strain on the whole staff, and we all kind of melted down one day last week when the restaurant was overrun by a sudden surge in hungry people. Our area was visited by hurricane evacuees this week, as well as the area manager. We’re still rocking along, maybe with a better idea on how to deal with the new volume in sales.

Our dilemma has been highlighted by some announcements by a nearby competitor. This competitor decided to ignore warnings from the state of Texas regarding who could stay open and who had to close. Dire consequences were threatened if bars who did not serve food with their drinks did not close. The only way to avoid penalties meted out by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission was to close. But this competitor was in a small town, and all tourism to the town was discouraged by closing the major events in town so far. I guess this businessman thought that he was safe enough as long as he was serving locals only. Someone complained and TABC paid a visit. Now this man is out of business as a part of the penalties that were assessed. It makes me grateful that I am working for a company that was bold enough to try a business expansion in the face of this restriction. But it also means that state authorities are watching closely."

2,journal-entry-2804," I found out this past weekend that I had been exposed to COVID 19. My brother tested positive, as did his wife and daughter. My brother and I visit my father at the nursing home where he is now living, at the same time each week. We sit over 6 feet away from my father, but are sitting next to each other. We both wear masks, but after the visit is over, we usually catch up about the my father's status and my brother will take his mask off.

I scheduled a COVID test at a local CVS for this past Monday. Fortunately this is covered by my insurance, was relatively close by and straightforward. It will take 2-4 days to get the results, so I am now in a waiting pattern and quarantining myself from everyone but my husband. My outside activities are solo walks with my dog, wearing a mask. Also, fortunately, I don't have any symptoms, but neither do my brother or his daughter. My sister-in-law has had a headache and mild fever, but is otherwise okay.

I am struck by how COVID travels. My 25 yo niece hasn't been carefully following the social distancing rules. Through her travels, she picked up COVID, which she gave to her parents, and possibly to me. I haven't seen my niece in over a year, but am still impacted by the decisions she is making. This makes the whole route of transmission of COVID really hit home - how we can be impacted by people we don't have contact with, and that contact can impact our lives. It is really frustrating that so many people aren't making wise decisions regarding COVID. "

Testing is very expensive in Greece, and not widely available away from cities, so most people vacationing on the island simply stayed at home until they felt better. Upon returning, some did tests, which came back negative. For others, they came back positive. But generally, I feel like this virus is much 'lighter' now that we have summer, with very high temperatures.

I wonder how warped the official cases picture is, and how difficult it is to statistically present an official figure for each country, given how difficult it is to record cases that may or may not have been Covid-related...

12,journal-entry-2677,"Honestly, this question is difficult to answer. I tend to critically analyze what the close relatives around me say, given that I often hear strongly biased views-my grandma especially is very socially conservative and does not support abortion. Because of this, she automatically aligns with conservative economic policy (even though she often complains about big business, globalization, etc. which are typically the result of conservative policy.) While I agree with some of what she says, her lack of critical analysis and tendency to jump to conclusions means I do not usually listen to her completely. My aunt is also a huge conspiracy theorist about things like ANTIFA. She also believes that food allergies are made up and that wearing seatbelts does more harm then good. So, I would say I do not really trust what my close family says politically. This is honestly difficult for me, because I am also a follower of Jesus (as they are) and am often confused by how politicized certain topics involving religion are.

I also do not tend to use the news as much, because I know that pretty much every site has some sort of bias. If I do, I'll probably use the NYT or Washington Post. I also tend to rely on academic literature, but that can be limiting given the long process of peer review. "

I worry about children who haven't seen their friends in months and have become depressed.

I worry about children who don't have access to computers to log in to classes.

I worry about children who are anxious about themselves or their parents getting sick.

I have no idea how old she was 30 years ago when she was so strict that I remember nothing except never to spell her name incorrectly, but today she is a sweet little older lady. She used to only wear brown and dark green, having had her ""colors done"" in the 80s as so many women did. Now she wore a soft pink and everything about her seemed softer. Did I shake a bit when she insisted I call her by her first name? Yup! But when she heard about my children's interests, her next question was to ask my address so she could send them books that they would like (and she was spot on - they love the books!). She exuded kindness, sweetness (6th-grade-me can't believe that's the word I just used!), and it was the most beautiful thing to be able to share myself and my family with her and to hear about her family (and to respond as an adult, almost a peer!). I hadn't planned this for the end but  as our time was running out I looked directly at the camera and said, THANK YOU. Thank you for being my teacher, for being in my life, for dealing with all of those disruptive 6th graders, and for so passionately caring about hundreds of children over decades of teaching.

Before that we self-isolated for 2 weeks so we could see our friends and then again when we got home out of respect for everyone. We did do one or two errands but that was it. Meanwhile we work at home, our friends work at home and they also self-isolated and are strict with their rules. Most people in our lives work either in healthcare or other high risk fields. When we see them I feel like we are more at risk anyway. I feel like we are overdoing it at the expense of our daughter’s mental health. When we stop isolating we will still social distance - but this is too much. When we get home from our next trip we will continue to distance ourselves as usual but not in this extreme way. And yesterday my daughter and I rode to the library (again we have done some errands) we saw so many kids riding their bikes together and it looked like a regular summer. Then there is my daughter who we keep pretty separate. You can’t help but start to doubt yourself.

But, it does take everyone to make it a success - to keep everyone well. And, I do believe it is worth it to ""reopen"" because  children need the education, the continued development of their development, not just opening up books, but also the social and emotional development.  I think it's more crucial now than ever. But, I also understand, that we are all going to need to be prepared to shut down again and go back to all online as best we can. That is one tool we have now that didn't exist during the pandemic in 1918 - computers. We need to continue to capitalize on that as much as possible.

 I also keep thinking of all the parents out there trying to juggle their job responsibilities at home, while caring for and educating their kids. That's a lot.  Especially, for single parents and for families where both parents are working full-time. Unfortunately, I feel like the way our social systems are set-up for families, leaves so many of them vulnerable and at risk of kids not getting the education they need if schools stay closed."

I read that Wuhan managed to eliminate it recently, and I saw pictures of huge concerts and parties taking place without any sort of protective equipment required. On the one hand, I feel envious that China managed to succeed in this respect. On the other hand, I feel that to achieve this, we all in the West need to accept being controlled and regulated 24/7, which goes against our cultural ethics and our belief in individual choice and autonomy."
5,journal-entry-2577,"[...]  The wide variations in how different countries are handling the pandemic do not surprise me.  Every country handles its medical, educational, military and financial policies differently, and those differences can add up to really big differences in results. [...]

 What HAS surprised me is how incredibly incompetent the United States has been in its handling of the pandemic. Its a great example of how anything can be politicized -- even facts and science -- so that our reactions and ideas can become both inefficient and potentially dangerous in the process.  Most of the world already thinks we are a strange, violent society with our guns and our constant flag waving and our refusal to embrace universal health care and our willingness to invade other countries on the basis of erroneous information and the whim of our leaders. Now they get to see how stupid and incompetent we are internally as well. The fact that a huge numbers of American citizens seem to be just fine with this incompetency just underscores what a complete and utter joke the United States is during this pandemic.[...]"

A pesar de esto, gracias a Dios que mi familia y yo nos hemos mantenido saludables y de alguna manera progresando. Estoy feliz con lo mucho que estoy aprendiendo de mí mismo y las actividades que he llevado realizando y perfeccionando en estos días.  Empecé un blog que me sirve para desahogarme y lo comparto entre mis contactos, de manera en que he recibido muy buenas reseñas de los que me rodean y esto me motiva a seguir escribiendo.  Tambien he estado escribiendo alguna que otra poesía que refleja mis sentimientos mixtos que he tenido en estos días atípicos que hemos pasado.

En resumidas cuentas estoy feliz, aunque con un poco de miedo porque las actividades empiezan a retomarse paulatinamente en el país y me da temor en que las decisiones que se están tomando no sean las correctas para la gente de ir levantando las medidas de restricción de movimiento.

Last week he started coughing, we immediately thought it was Coronavirus so he got tested. Since he is a health care worker, he was tested in his own hospital and got the results the same day. The results were negative. We were lucky, most of the people have to make long lines to be tested, and wait around two weeks to receive the results. I can’t imagine start labor and the hospital denied my husband to be with me, under suspicion of being infected by the virus.

I have not seen my college friends since march when I moved off of campus, I had to move back in with my family and fully quarantined for several months.

13,journal-entry-2543,"Unfortunately, I think it speaks to the overarching attitudes and culture in those different places.  I think particularly in the South, we've seen the overall attitude of ""it's my right not to wear a mask"" and then we've been seeing these huge breakouts there.  I also think there is a dangerous attitude of ""I won't get it,"" and the belief that this pandemic isn't real, which those people then partake in the huge parties and celebrations (i.e. weddings, anniversaries, bar mitzvahs, etc.) with huge numbers of breakouts afterwards and heartbreaking videos of people dying from COVID trying to warn people not to make the same mistake they made.  

Most recently, I saw on the news that people were coming out from everywhere in Sturgis, South Dakota, for the annual motorcycle rally, despite the outcry from the local members in that community saying they didn't want it this year.  I have family out there and it's worrisome to know that so many from all around the country flooded into that community, and without taking any precautions (no facemasks, etc.), possibly spreading it to that community.  There is a reservation near there and I heard that members of the reservation were blocking the road going into their community because they didn't want to risk that exposure to their community from the motorcyclists.  

And, I know a lot of people are really worried about schools reopening.  I think we're going to see where people are taking precautions that it will work just fine, and where they aren't, there will be huge outbreaks.  "

The assistance provided by the government is not enough. So many people are falling through the cracks, and when the eviction moratorium is over it'll be even worse.

Things will not be the same.This lack of sleep or insomnia had an effect on my studies. I was used to being physically present on the college campus. This provided me with the surety that I could easily ask for clarity when I was unsure of the subject matter being taught. This opportunity was not readily available when I needed it.

It was very difficult for me in the beginning, but my mother's words of encouragement pushed me along. I learnt to email my professors and wait for their response, sometimes which was not immediate.This is how I literally understood the phrase,"" Patience is Virtue"".

19,journal-entry-2520,"As I look at the wall in my room, I notice a large sheet of unlined paper I pinned to the wall from an artbook of mine. On it, I wrote the names of 5 of my close friends, along with the title ""Post-Corona Plans"" with a stylized crown on the side of the letters. Next to each of my friends' names is a briefn list of activities to o after coronavirus is over, some say travel, some refer to specific restaurants to visit, and others are activities like hiking. I made the list sometime around April or May, about a month or so into the start of the virus becoming so prevalent in the country.

When I wrote the list, I assumed that at a hard date when the pandemic was officially declared 'over,' I would be able to do all of these things with my friends. However, as I look at my list now, with some items being crossed off, others crossed out, I realize that my list is serving as a metaphor for how the world might open up, how it already has, and how the pandemic will come to an end in the future. Some of my items have already been completed, such as hiking while maintaining proper distance, and going on a birthday road trip with a friend after we both tested negative for Covid. I realize that the end of the pandemic won't be the difference between black and white, but a soft gradient  of an end, with restrictions being lifted slowly over time until one day, we'll realize that things have gone back to normal after months or years of things easing down.

I hope that as things continue to open safely and slowly I will be able to complete all of the items on my list soon, as the pandemic made me realize how much I value the times with my friends, and I really can't be away from them for much longer."

Before the virus, whenever I thought about birthdays, getting older, or even the prospect of death, I didn't think of it with the element of fear and dread like I do now. It's like my mind had been tainted by the thought and it obscures my celebrations of everything good that's been happening to me lately. I am the type of person to understand what happens in the end, but use that at a positive catalyst to enjoy my life without a backdrop of fear.

However, either due to the all-encompassing nature of the virus or my own corona scare, it seems like a feint black veil has been placed behind the stage of my life, and I sense it more and more when I have good moments.

That was my first thought. Ignorance, disregard for anyone other than themselves and complete lack of common sense is killing people and ruining or negatively affecting the lives of everyone else.

Leadership makes a huge difference and that is why I believe NJ is doing better than some. The culture where I live seems to follow basic rules but I will tell you - after hearing stories of lifeguard parties at the beach where attendees get sick (lifeguards!!) and the voices of entitlement on the YouTube Board of Education meeting in my town demanding they pay less taxes if their kids are not in school full time.

And I never do, but it's fucking tiring to remind patrons multiple times to just keep their mask on, or remind the professional staff and other volunteers to do the same. So I gave up last week. I told them I was not returning to volunteer until I could control my anger. And I still do not have great control, but instead I have limited my hours, so I work at it.

 by far the most creative thing I'm doing today that I was not doing at all before the pandemic is keeping this journal. 

...

When the pandemic began to effect CT and the USA earlier this year, it felt like such a momentous occasion, probably the biggest event I have ever personally experienced (as I've noted in prior entries), and I wanted to consistently record what it was like for myself and for my future grandchildren (if I have any). Its been fun to think about my entries and what I find important each week. I like to go on your website to see what others are experiencing -- so different from my own experiences in that many people have lost jobs or loved ones and I have been very lucky in that regard. I still can't believe my 83 year old, wheel-chair bound, stroke-victim and brain-addled mother not only survived COVID but was completely asymptomatic! I feel blessed everyday for that. Its also interesting to see how my journal entries reflect the mood and experiences of a small, rural, mainly white, New England town with extremely low COVID numbers, and so are very, very different from the mood and experiences documented by other people and communities in this country and around the world on your website. Its reminded me of the tremendous variety of life experiences in the world.

...

Perhaps more importantly, you've also given us a chance to share and preserve what we've written which is really important.

It's hard to discern something that happened a week ago from a month or two months ago. I realize this happens anyways, but it's much more drastic while we're going through the pandemic. I enjoyed seeing a clip from Colbert's show recently which showed him taking of pages from a day calendar that read ""March 12"" and he keeps tearing off pages, but they all read ""March 12.""

8,journal-entry-2365,"My older son has had the virus for the past week but is now on the mend. He was quite disagreeable while sick but I think much of that had to do with believing he was responsible for spreading it to friends. He traveled to Mississippi, Chicago and Texas. It was in Texas that he either contracted it from his friend or spread it himself. Who knows. His friend came down with it the day my son left. My son did not get it until the following day. Does that indicate who is the vector? They had a small gathering of friends at a pool in Texas. Everyone who attended got it. My son did not bother to get tested. He had every symptom - including loss of taste. The lines are too long, the results are not received in a timely enough manner to make any kind of difference.

So, now both kids have had it - my younger son in Boulder, my oldest in LA. I wish I could see them during this 90 day window we have where they are immune but both are busy now with school starting in a few weeks. All but one of my younger son's classes will be on line which is such a disappointment for him because he was looking forward to his junior year and getting to know his professors in his core classes.

My nephew has almost recovered from Covid. ... He came down about the same time as my son but since he is seven years older his symptoms were worse. He had greater fatigue and fevers. Poor guy, he is quarantining and hasn't seen his wife and kids in weeks.

During these last few weeks the virus has definitely felt like it is closing in. I'm glad my kids are in college and graduate school and I am not having to deal with sending them to high school in the middle of this nightmare."

As such, I am have been locked in my bedroom for 5 days now, never leaving. I am fortunate enough to have a bathroom attached to my bedroom, one that I do not share with my flatmate. I am also fortunate enough to possess a variety of electric cooking appliances suitable for cooking for one. I have a small counter, a ""dressing table"" between my bedroom and my bathroom, which I am currently using as a makeshift kitchen. I have a coffeemaker, a miniature crockpot, and a wafflemaker, all electric. I have one set of utensils, a chef's knife, a wooden spoon, and a whisk. I have a mixing bowl, an eating bowl, a plate, a mug, a cup, and a cutting board. I have two dish towels which serve as drying mats after I wash my dishes in my bathroom sink. I use the toilet as a garbage disposal, scraping uneaten food into it - I can't put it in a trash bag, and it won't keep as I have no refrigeration. My flatmate brings any food I order for delivery to my bedroom door; I take it after he has walked away.

Under the dressing table I have all manner of nonperishable food: canned fish, canned vegetables, ramen noodles, pasta, tortillas, pita (the latter two will perish, but don't need to be kept cold). I have some produce that can be kept at room temperature: a yellow and a red onion, some red delicious apples, and a bunch of bananas. Oh, and two avocados (which must be eaten today) and a bulb of garlic.

I am a teacher, and I have been receiving guidance on how the new school year will go once it begins. They are planning on splitting the population into 3 cohorts and sending them to school for half-days at a time, with one group at a time in the building, to allow for social distancing. I predict that we will close back down and go to full virtual learning sometime at the beginning of October.

The pandemic has mostly left me bored. It is summer - my time off, my time to accomplish the things that I couldn't do the rest of the year: play video games, study something new, do large projects, travel. But video games and studying are boring now, since it has become all I can do. Projects are difficult, since getting supplies requires going out. And while Jersey is relatively safe, it is only so because we avoid going out. I want to spend time with people - but that's simply not logistically possible. And now, in the last few weeks before my school year begins again, I am trapped in quarantine.

I plan on getting a COVID test today or tomorrow. a negative result will free me from quarantine, but I don't know that it will come quickly enough for it to matter. Which is frustrating."

I think that many office buildings will need to be repurposed into other things-- e.g. homes, greenhouses, or knocked down to make parks, etc.  Good riddance!  I hate offices and I'm so glad to see that era of office work come to an end."

Jugábamos, comíamos juntas, mirábamos dibujos animados. Ahora, solo nos hemos comunicado por audio o videollamada con ayuda de su mamá, y me resulta adorable y doloroso verla pedir a través de la pantalla que le haga upa, así como sus audios pidiendo verme.

 Incluso su madre me ha llegado a contar que cuando siente sonidos fuera de la casa la pequeña piensa que soy yo, llegando al punto de llorar al no verme en la puerta. 

La extraño mucho, y no me gustó perderme su cumpleaños."

Por otro lado, yo tengo que cuidar de las hija de la novia de mi papa,  nunca he cuidado a niños de tiempo completo, se que suelen ser latosos y con mucha energía, esta situación me hace platearme dudas, sobre si en el futuro quiero hijos,  ya que es muy cansado tanto física y mentalmente."
3,journal-entry-2061,"I'm so glad you asked this question. It's so important to try and stay focused on the positive where/when we can.

Things that bring me happiness are sowing my garden, pickling the cucumbers I have grown, tending to my house plants, cuddling with my cat, talking with my son and daughter, playing guitar, zooming for my bi-weekly book club with my 12 year old niece, cooking, writing fiction, writing in my journal, and yoga!

I Might add that this pandemic journal also brings me happiness. I love the idea that some day, somewhere someone will read our words and hear what we went through. It's not the pandemic itself that is the problem, I think. It is the human response to it--in particular the US government. But it's also a wider symptom of how bad humans are at sharing the planet with other species. We have the science. We know we need to increase biodiversity and protect habitat. But corporate and individual greed get in the way. Paradoxically, writing this last paragraph actually made me happy. Even though it's a depressing theme, I am happy it's going into a record somewhere!"

Por ejemplo, he estado produciendo una canción que es un cover de una de mis bandas favoritas. He aprendido a usar un programa de edición para realizarla. En la vida normal no hubiera tenido el tiempo para hacer esto, es algo positivo en mi opinión y sirve para no pensar mucho en la pandemia. "
5,journal-entry-2180,"I'm on a Greek island now ..., and while cases are rising in different parts of Greece, things here remain calm. I get angry seeing some people acting 'resistant' and not wanting to socially distance or even wear their mask properly. On the island here, though people have been quite careful from the beginning, I see a phenomenon called 'the little mask' worn by many professionals in the restaurant business. It's a patent made and sold locally, and this 'mask' is a piece of plastic which is attached to the lower chin, and only covers the mouth, not the nose. It's also quite removed from the mouth, and I am not sure it truly protects anyone, really. If someone were to sneeze wearing this, I am not sure anyone around this person would be protected.

I also hear more and more people are starting to spread the 'conspiracy' rumor, though I am not exactly sure what this conspiracy is. Something about Bill Gates, or 5G, or how 'THEY' want to control 'US'. Also, many people reason that, since they don't have someone close to them who has been directly affected, it must be 'terrorism' spread by governments and the media."

7,journal-entry-2163,"I have a recurring dream. It's a nightmare. I see a tall bookshelf in our bedroom (it doesn't exist!) and on the top of the bookshelf there's a fragile vase. The vase is about to fall off the bookshelf and shatter. I wake up - and I wake myself up - with a gasp, a jump, and I'm out of the bed, rushing to the bookshelf that does not exist to catch the vase that is not falling. Sometimes I wake my husband with my loud gasp and my frantic movements. I'm then awake and terrified the rest of the night. Sometimes the dream has a different story - I hear a doorbell and must jump up out of bed to help someone - but it's the same feeling of anxiety, responsibility, and unrest.

I know what this dream is about. I am struggling with the added pressures as a mom in this pandemic. I've always been the CEO of the family and my husband is the COO. He is fabulous; he does a LOT. But it's all stored in my head. Each of our kids has his own google calendar (since March) so I need to monitor these, plus my husband's work schedule, plus my own. It's exhausting. And terrifying. I'm always worried that I'm forgetting to do something or to tell one of my kids to be on a zoom. I've been on important calls and I've interrupted to call out to the other room, ""Honey, can you please make sure our son is on his juggling camp zoom?""

My head hurts. There's always more to do and nowhere to go. I'm ready to wake up from this global nightmare."
8,journal-entry-2195,"When I was an undergraduate I studied in West Berlin for my junior year. Prior to German reunification, families were separated by a wall – and were not allowed to travel in order to connect. I never thought I’d be in a similar situation. But you see, I live in Rhode Island and all my east-coast family all live across the border in Massachusetts, about 1 hour away. Mind you, a trip to Massachusetts is not really “traveling” for me – I can walk to Massachusetts from my house. I get fresh produce and other curb-side groceries in Massachusetts – neither of which is available at curbside anywhere near where I live. My employer is in Massachusetts, although for now I am working at home. Providence and surrounding Massachusetts (yes they surround us…) are in the same media market. We are really one community. Yet the governor of Massachusetts has issued a travel ban for Rhode Island. Being someone who is careful to follow the law, I wondered exactly what that meant… and wondered if I could go to my produce shop 1 mile over the border. Would I be able to see my family? At all? Or am I separated from them until the pandemic is over? Unable to find any details about this travel ban (other than the requirement for a 2-week quarantine or a negative COVID test within 72 hours, and a $500 per day fine for violators – does this make ANY sense for a brief day-trip?). I called the police department in the closest Massachusetts town for guidance.

The officer who answered the phone was very nice, but equally unclear about what the travel ban actually meant. He said, “you know what, I live in Rhode Island…” (Ironic, but not surprising.) His advice was, short trips into Massachusetts is OK for shopping, and as long as you didn’t stay long, it was allowable, he thought. I asked, “So, it sounds like, as long as you don’t stay overnight, then it’s OK?” He thought that sounded right, but he remained somewhat unsure. (If the police don’t know the rules, how can the rest of us know?) Going to work, going for medical care, passing through the state to go elsewhere were also apparently OK.

But what about seeing my family? I live alone – and am the only one in my family living in Rhode Island. Further, I am perhaps among the most careful people around – adhering to mask rules, never going into a building other than my house, not allowing others into my house – only meeting people when necessary at a distance outside, everyone with masks – and I work from home remotely. Yet, for my mental health, I need to see my family from time to time. I wonder - will I be spending Thanksgiving alone – instead of at a small outdoor gathering of my immediate family? That feeling tugs at my heart.

Beyond sadness, the situation also makes me feel persecuted – much like those German people I recall from the cold war who yearned to see loved ones on the other side of the wall. And there is really nothing I can do about my situation as it is being imposed on me and the people of Rhode Island by a neighboring state in which we have no vote. I find tha it is increasingly difficult to keep my spirits up, and this does not help."

10,journal-entry-2053,"I don't think it was a conscious idea, but I stopped praying.

When I had to go out of the house, I would pray every morning, sometimes also in the afternoon. I went to shul every Shabbat.

Now it is rare that I will pray. I don't want to get dressed. Or I don't really feel like talking to God or mumbling the words. I don't know if or why it is important.

A few weeks ago when my husband and I heard davening in our backyard, we quickly got dressed and went to the outdoor shul. I was excited to see what it was going to be like. I was hoping for some excitement or feeling of awe for the first time in months being part of a community or hearing the Torah read. And all I felt, in the end, was a desire to run away, and that I was stuck.

It struck me last week when i was sitting in my garden, in shorts and a tank top, reading a novel, while I overheard the Torah reading. I had no desire to run to get dressed or even enter that space again.

The rituals I still do are go to the mikvah. Which I question more now, of what is this water really doing. Is it worth all the planning and arranging that I need to do so I can go?

Shabbat, which I appreciate as the one day that I don't have to focus on my computer. Although at times I want to have interactions with people other than my husband. But overall it is nice to have a day where I don't feel bad about sitting in the sun and reading.

I am curious as to how Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur will feel this year. Not sure if I will go to shul or if there will be shul.

I am also a rabbi --- so I am not sure how I will be able to [be] present or helpful to others who are also feeling a lack of connection.  I am not sure if it is a loss of faith or perhaps just a loss of desire for strict rituals."
11,journal-entry-1947,"The days are seeming to drag on more. I want to go out and do something, like I would have before - see a movie, eat out with friends, go to a show or just have a little get-together. But a lot of that isn't possible, and what is possible feels too dangerous. I don't want to risk getting COVID just to eat at a restaurant, and I don't want to risk exposing others to do that. Takeout is just gonna have to be enough.

I'm becoming more certain that we'll be doing this into next year. The government isn't taking the proper action, and things are just getting worse and worse. I'm tired."
12,journal-entry-1983,"I can’t stop thinking about the week before the shutdown. I was so overwhelmed - I’d taken on way too many projects, having said “yes” to everything, and it had come back to me in the ass. I was in performances for one show and rehearsals for two others, preparing for a concert in LA, taking on more and more classes and voice students, and I knew I wouldn’t have a day to myself until mid-summer.

I told my mother one day, in late February, “I wish everything would just... pause.” I just wanted the entire world to take a breather, so that I could too. I was going mad with stress. I wanted it all to just stop.

And a week later, it did. First, I learned that one show would not be continuing after the first weekend of performances. The next day, two other shows were cancelled. My obligations and commitments dropped like dominoes, one after the other. And I felt a deep grief for each cancellation, almost like mourning. I didn’t get to hug my students goodbye. It seemed like it all happened so fast. And it felt like I’d wished on a monkey’s paw.

Five months later, I’ve done more than I thought I would. But I still miss live theatre more than anything. I’m feeling restless to start again. The world’s been stopped for too long."

16,journal-entry-2025,"At first the pandemic was exciting. Everyone was talking about it, and things felt tense at work since we didn't know what was happening. The transition to working remotely happened essentially overnight, and all I remember from the time period right after is an intense period of activity as I transitioned myself to this new format. I think I channeled some of my anxiety into work and focused it in being as productive as possible. The amount I did was insane! Yet at the same time, I started feeling burnt out, and I realized that I needed to take a step back and consider my mental health. I was exhausted those first few weeks.

I also felt some anxiety about whether I would be laid off from my job, but luckily the market turbulence works in our favor. I was really nervous about that for a few days, plus worry about how the virus would impact my health and that of my friends and family. There were so many unknowns that it made me anxious, but as we learn more about the virus and effective prevention, I feel more comfortable going outside or going to the grocery store. The uncertainty more than anything bothered me.

There was a time in May and June when the quarantine doldrums really hit. I think I was bothered by some things going on at work as well, and felt incredibly demotivated and anxious about the amount of work I had. I think the anxiety kept me from doing work! I didn't want to do anything, and I felt that my work didn't matter. Every day started feeling the same, like I was in my own version of Groundhog Day. That's when I started noticing how despite all the days feeling the same... time passed by very quickly. I blinked on Monday and it was suddenly Friday.

I think the monotony is the challenge now. I'm craving any sort of change from my usual work and my apartment. Going to my parent's was the right call, as is starting a new exercise program. It's really helping me push through the boredom and same-ness. Traveling to visit my boyfriend will also help a lot, as awful as the drive out will be. I feel confident that I will be able to find ways to change up my life now, whereas before it was this waiting pattern until my boyfriend left for med school and staying in the city together. Now I have some serious change coming my way, and it's helping me differentiate days and create excitement and actual things to look forward to again.

Who knows what problems I will face in a month? For now, I feel like the monotony will slowly fade away."
17,journal-entry-1856,"I live in a studio with my husband.

We have been living here since September, when I moved to the country, 2 months after getting civilly married. The goal was to move once I got a job --- but that hasn't happened yet.

We joke that we went from a long-distance relationship to living in a studio, to being in 'shelter at home' in a studio. And boy has it been tough at times.

We have taken to sometimes using the bathroom as a separate room.

It means that if we have a fight, we still have to sit in the same room with each other OR walk out of the house to take a break. It means that when I wake up 3 hours before my husband I need to work quietly and he just needs to get used to little bits of noise in the morning because there is nowhere else for me to sit. It means either sitting at the table or on my bed throughout the day.

Thankfully we have a garden - which I have used very often during the nice days. I honestly don't know what I would have done if I didn't have the garden. I feel so bad for everyone who did not have an outdoor space to go to.

The studio also only has a mini fridge - which means that we are unable to stock up on food. There also isn't really storage space for non-fridge food. It took some time to get used to shopping during COVID. As we live next to a grocery store, we were used to going 2-3 times a week to stock up, and now we try to only go once a week and find places to store everything. We are making do with that.

My husband and I joke, that if we are able to make it through COVID in a studio, we will be fine for anything else that comes our way in the future."
18,journal-entry-1944,"Dear PJP,

This past week the corona virus pandemic has enabled me with the time to organize a Protest and community discussion against racism and police violence. The event was very successful as we were able to begin to create the fertile soil that can allow the BIPOC community to not just live but flourish. As we continue our social & racial justice work ... we are trying to find news ways to listen, understand and implement tangible change within our communities. It has truly been a trans-formative experience.

Also, within the last week I start working again at one of my three jobs, ...  the one I was most apprehensive of going back to because the nature of the work I do there requires me to be in close contact with people. ...

...

As I begin to venture back into society though I still very nervous about the possibility of catching corona-virus. It makes me even more frustrated that our president has choose not to lead and take effective change but instead has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to died at his hands. I thought it could not get any worse with him, but somehow it always does. Thus, because of the lack of action taken to contain/ control this virus I fear catching it and bringing home to my more susceptible family members."
19,journal-entry-1987,"Strange indirect Coronavirus realization this week.. my child thinks the mailman is like Santa. He thinks the mailman just brings him presents everyday. I was talking with my friend who as a child the same age as my son (3 years old) and she was saying that her daughter said she was going to ask the mailman for a present. 

I guess this is normal for a young child to make sense of. But, I realized today just how much we have become reliant on ordering things from Amazon that we would have normally just gone out and purchased at a store. We have almost daily deliveries now of random things we need, where as before I would have just run out to Target. 

And, so now, my child thinks our mailman is Santa. "
20,journal-entry-1978,"This weekend I watched as an older brother taught his younger brother the basics of baseball. My heart swelled. I was quite emotional watching the two brothers in the park as  I sat inside watching through my living room window. The older brother was about 15 and the younger brother about 9. The patience and love showcased by the older brother were just heart-warming. I felt nostalgic for them just watching.

Fortunately, here in Scotland things are being handled much more effectively. I feel safer here then I would down in England, however you do get silly people everywhere who think the virus has somehow now gone...It is very much still here.

2,journal-entry-1929,Many things regarding politics have turned upside down in my point of view  and that's because of the reopening of schools being relied and linked to politics rather than public health which is bad because not every politician have experience such experience that the people are experiencing and not every one of them know the core of health and what's needed for the people and what should be avoided. Many of the politics want things to go back to normal to regulate the flow of things that were once taking place before the pandemic but at these times we should all be more careful than sorry because the minute a school reopens with the many kids and teenagers in them the virus will ravage the places making potential new epicenters throughout the city. This type of decision will do more harm than any good the step I believe politics should take is having every kid and teenager getting access to home school or maybe at least for the ones that mostly need it like special education children's at home. Maybe my opinion may not be accurate but I strongly believe that the politicians should take all of this into consideration and make things preferable for everyone's sake and this countries sake as well.

I’m super pro vaccine, I’m a biology major, and want to work in a hospital, and at the same time I am so distrustful of the federal government at this point that I am not going to get that vaccine right away. They want to roll it out so low income communities and communities of color have “access first”. Maybe good intentions, but it’s not a good look.

Yoho for his slander earlier in the week. Dad's cough is not getting any better. we're still waiting for his COVID-19 test results. He's been home for nearly a month awaiting test results. For someone who is used to being busy and working it's not easy for him to stay home. He's not abiding by strict quarantine guidelines. Our daily and family needs don't allow it.

When data shows that BIPOC is disproportionately affected by COVID, I understand why. Although we have sufficient income to not worry about necessities like groceries, bills, and living expenses, the (extended) family relies on him for too much. I wish he could stay home and rest. I wish he could not worry about everyone else's worries.

So Sunday was a nice departure from the daily COVID-19 grind. Dad napped throughout the morning and early afternoon after spending a few hours in the yard. I made fish tacos with homemade corn tortillas. Dinner was served with white wine. A fine Sunday if I ever knew one."

It has been really heartbreaking for our lab, and of course his family and friends. There is grief for both him, and also how he died. It is almost a double grief. It's hard to believe he's gone. He was such a wonderful person. He was quirky with a great sense of humor. And he contributed so, so much to his field of work. He had his hands in so many projects because of his expertise. But despite his merit, he was not intimidating at all. You could ask him any question, and he was happy to help or to teach. He had a lot of knowledge about a lot of things. I did not have the same role as him, but I still learned so much from him in the three years I knew him because he knew so much about anything and everything. I had the office next to him and I am dreading the next time I have to go in (we're working from home) because he won't be there (he came to campus each day) and he won't be coming back. It already feels very weird without him. And Covid is impacting our grief. We cannot get together, we can't give hugs or touches on the arm, there is no memorial service or funeral. It is just making things so much harder."

It actually worked out well. But then the gas company knocked on my door unannounced and an unmasked technician wanted access to my house – my sanctuary – my safe place. I did not let him in. Then – my service light came on in my car – another sanctuary and safe place. I needed service and there was no alternative to that. So… I braced myself, used sheets to cover my front seats, and packed up my cleaning supplies. I stayed outside in the hot sun as my car was serviced, but even though I was in the far corner of a parking lot, it was hard to avoid unmasked people who had no regard for my safety. It was almost like they came near me for no reason and on purpose. It was enraging – but there was nothing I could do but to try to move farther away from them.

When my car was done, I pulled out the cleaning supplies and cleaned off all the interior surfaces, aired out the car, and removed the sheets before driving home with the windows open. I feel like I did everything I could possibly have done – but it was unnerving and very stressful. It was a greater level of risk than I am used to so that was hard. I was exhausted when I got home – but changed my clothes and showered before I did anything else.

Now that our disease numbers are good for the time being, I feel that I should take care of things to avoid problems when things get bad again. But in order to do that I have to leave my comfort zone… and that is really hard to do."

But Nana is still recovering from Covid and has stage 3 kidney failure. Of course she welcomed the party at her home even though it would be a lot of work for her and expose her to 10 people who may or may not be observing the social distancing rules. We sent a lengthy and stern email to our sister in law explaining the danger to Nana. Other family members responded that they thought it would be safe since it was ""only"" 10 people. To our relief she cancelled the party. We feel bad that our niece wont be having a party but the health of our loved ones must come first. The next joyous event was our daughter's first birthday.

That’s what it feels like.

I am worried about what it’s going to look like when school starts. I am a teacher. Every single day there are different hints. Hints only. No one has come up with a real concrete plan. They’ll SAY they have shared plans. But really? 2 pages in an email is a plan for dealing with this?

So today the TEA (State of Texas Education Authority) put out their “plan”. It is not a plan. It is a statement that schools will start in person. Parents can opt out. No accommodations for teachers unless they have verified disabilities. Masks are required, but not for kids under 10. I teach first grade. So, potentially, I have a full class of kids with no masks. TEA says they ordered masks. I did the math. They ordered enough for every student in the state for a 10 day supply. Hardly adequate. Everyone needs to be tested. Is that daily? Weekly? One time only? Whatever it is, I’m sure it’s not adequate.

And we are in the midst of a huge surge.

12,408 cases. 2,000 more since Thursday. Less than one week. In our county. That’s not even the state.

482 more cases TODAY.

151 deaths. 18 more since last Thursday.

89 on ventilators

73 new hospital admissions today

Our 7 day moving average is 74.8

We have gone over the number of 70 for overwhelming our hospitals.

Also getting medical attention is a problem. I did have a doctors visit and dentist visit in the last month and used something called a GoBus, which is a public transportation van reserved for seniors

My IPhone and iPad also broke down this month and needed to go to ATT store for replacement. Transportation was an issue and was forced to use public transportation.

My memories of the 1950s and '60s have informed my teaching as I have seen so many social justice issues that apply to the perceptions (negative and positive) that my international students bring into the classroom. Yet the BLM attention has led me to ""attending"" webinars to examine my own bias and to gain a deeper understanding of what I can do in my classes, and in my life, and that is sometimes to confirm rather than to add something to my understanding....

So when you ask, “How is the coronavirus pandemic affecting your life right now?” My answer is that I’m trying to love myself. ..."
3,journal-entry-994,"During the pandemic, I’ve had more time to explore Instagram and social media generally. With the recent upsurge of BLM, so much art and statements have been made, and it’s made me feel more bold. I’ve found more people who think like me or make me feel comfortable being upset with America’s white supremacy.

Additionally, since I’m stuck at home with my mom, I’ve been watching the news more (since my mom watches). The news makes me more aware of what politicians are doing on a federal level (I try to ignore it the best I can, for sanity sake). I’m frustrated with what’s going on and frankly, disappointed with news reporters. They’re really not as smart as they think. Some of them are truly dangerous, almost as dangerous as the politicians. They contribute to the breeding of ignorance and hate, sometimes."
4,journal-entry-1012,"For the first four months of the pandemic, I was in lockdown in Spain, my husband's home country, and he was in lockdown in the US. It was very strange. We were each looking after each other's mothers. I came back a few weeks ago to the US and we had two weeks together. The first week we couldn't relate to each other. Our experiences were so radically different, he could not understand mine nor express his. After much fighting and crying and drinking and melting down, we finally got to a better place. We had a nice week together. And then he left to go see his mom. Over six months we will have been together two weeks, one of them bad. I feel like a military spouse, which I know isn't fair--I wasn't fighting or in danger, but it does feel like we are under siege, especially here, in the US, where there is so much uncertainty and it feels like we have all been left to fend for ourselves. In Spain, it wasn't like that. The Government took control and told everyone what to do. And mostly, people did it, because their concern was for their neighbor and family and the greater good of society. I cannot relate to the individualistic attitudes here, because these attitudes and behaviors damage other people. ..."
5,journal-entry-949,"My children are grown. But I am a teacher and I can tell you first hand that this pandemic is affecting the education of children. This is not normal and education will not be normal. There is no way to make it normal. Distance learning is not a substitute for in class learning. This should put to rest all the aspersions on teachers and the implication that teachers can be replaced by technology. Simply untrue.

That said, the children will be fine. Most will catch up quickly. They are sponges. In addition, our curriculum is overloaded. Not everything needs to be taught in every year. Those who struggle will require extra help. Maybe a lot of kids will graduate a year or two later. THAT'S OK! In the long run, they will be fine. This will not do any permanent damage.

For now, we need to focus on basic needs of survival. Kids can't learn without those needs being met anyhow. So, sending them to school stressed or scared, making them sit far away from friends, not having the usual closeness that a classroom provides, will not help them learn anyway. Let's get through this first. Teachers will help them catch up. We've got this!"
6,journal-entry-951,"In January I moved across the country with my husband and daughter and in March there's a pandemic. the compounded effects of moving, leaving lots of friends and family and a job behind, and then being even more isolated by the pandemic has made me feel insanely anxious, like I am going out of my mind. I have also experienced really intense depression. This pandemic has made me put on hold all of my aspirations and plans. I have never had so much trouble sleeping. There have been nights where I turn out the lights only to be kept awake by my unrelenting heart rate. I feel like I have been in survival mode for months and I worry about the longterm effects of this on my health. I also feel like my body has aged ten years -- I have a lot more wrinkles on my face and my joints hurt. I am so sick of feeling this way that sometimes I feel furious with how stuck I feel. I am pretty sure I will never find a job and I have two masters. I am over qualified for most things and under qualified for everything else. On the other hand I am terrified that I will find a job because then I would have to put my daughter in daycare and I am so scared of her getting sick.

8,journal-entry-913,"this is complicated since I'm doing the math of steady rises in cases on the east coast and midwestern states adjacent to us here in NYC and I've estimated that I will have to stay indoors for the next 2 years, and hopefully will no longer be the spirit of the cursed prophet Cassandra and have to once again make the choice of dragging my half rotting body to the mountaintops to scream against a backdrop of chaos for the sake of dying with fire in my lungs or if I just finally release myself from this voluntary show and go quietly into the night since the society I have been forced into doesn't care about me, and the novel times I hoped to be alive for, will just be fictional hopes from generations before me. If anything I am reminded of the generations after the wars waged in other countries, where children were robbed of their chances to dream. Children now may never see beaches, be outside for hours, see sunsets, see trees, they will not dream. They will grieve as I am for the things that will never be, that were promised generation after generation only to become a debt for the impulsivity of people who had their heydays, who saw the sun and laughed, who had children, who had money and a place to live and yet they just keep punching the future in the face with their immovable stances on how to do things the right way. It is no longer safe to think of a tomorrow, or a day outside in the world. Maybe dedicating my moments of robbed adulthood to the dark academia of studying death could be of use, or maybe just accepting the fact I was never meant to live gaily would be better. I am unsure what is the point of our continuation to hope if not for the sake of screaming into the nothingness. I am starting to believe in the theories of the universe being the corpse of a long-forgotten ancient diety and we are all just growing ecosystems of life, profiting off their physical absence. Strange that I was bargained into not believing in a just death for myself was not an option, but all I have lucked out on is dying with a cold calloused world of the global north setting itself on fire, and dooming what they could not conquer with it. We are all but crabs climbing on one another to avoid an assuredly painful death. I wonder what will become of the idea of a future. Will, there be the idea of dreaming again. Will nights be filled with the hum of hope again? Will the songs of dark times no longer keep us company? I do not know, all I do know is the scriptures of our history do not rhyme, they repeat themselves into prophecies, and we are all fools for believing in the notions of dead ghosts."

10,journal-entry-739,"I feel angry at those who have ignored lock down and the rules. They are so selfish thinking that this doesn't affect them. It affects everyone. My close friend has lost her mum because of this virus. She's only 21, her mum was barely 50. I am also annoyed at the Government that their selfish and arrogant attitude towards this virus has cost thousands of lives. Why are they not being held accountable? I am so glad Scotland has devolved power over health and education so we can make better choices compared to England. 

The amount of people who are always in the parks sitting in massive groups, even before it was allowed to have picnics, should be held accountable too. And what is with people not understanding the 2 meter rule? The amount of times I have to move out the way because they won't is infuriating, like, sure, I'll just press myself against a wall/ walk into the road to avoid you? I just wish everyone started taking accountability for their actions. "
11,journal-entry-758,"I really hate the fact that the president has tried to make the problem more about the economy than the the health of the people. By doing that he has gotten the masks to be a political symbol equating mask wearing with the democratic side of the upcoming election. I heard Trump referred to as the agent of chaos. This seems to fit him to a tee. He can’t rise to any level of competency by guiding the nation financially or medically. The racial issues, partly financial in nature, are even further complicated by Trump’s own bigotry. Again he becomes the agent of chaos. Then there is the fact that the president doesn’t even seem to read his press briefings to see that his cozying up to Putin has gotten him possible bounty to those who can kill American servicemen in the Middle East....

Unfortunately the economic impact will be huge. For good or bad, who knows now, this pandemic may permanently alter some institutions. One is the realm of small business and how it survives or not. The other permanent change may be in the way education is delivered. It should teach us about one major flaw in our economy and that is the huge number of people who live paycheck to paycheck. So many have not even a week to survive without pay, and they bear children into these risky situations. We should not have hungry children whose families rely on free breakfast and lunch programs at school. ..."
12,journal-entry-687,"This has been a good week in my part of the country.  Our numbers look good, and they are getting better.  Meanwhile, there are some really scary numbers coming from the south and the west. What I don't understand are these people who have made a big deal about wearing a mask.  Why?  It makes me think that there are people in the US who care for no one but themselves, and to hell with protecting others - because, ya know, it is my right to be a complete jerk.  Their thinking is warped. And when they get sick, we are all supposed to feel sorry for them.  The fact that these people are not shamed by their behavior is a mystery to me.  

Meanwhile, I continue my ""stock up for a year"" project.  I fear that things here will get bad again -- and that certain foods and commodities will be scarce again -- that online shopping will be overtaxed and that shipping will once again be overloaded with long delays.  So I am preparing.  All the staples I need for a year are now in my basement.  Toiletries, dry goods, canned goods, soaps and detergents, and paper goods etc.  This helps me worry less, and eases my mind. And -- even if we don't have another spike, I'll be all set for the next year on all these items.  So -- win-win. 

Still working at home, and I see no end to this until we have a vaccine.  They are talking about vaccine availability at the beginning of 2021, but I am betting on next Spring.  "
13,journal-entry-688,"I guess - kinda -- sometimes -- people are supporting one another. I actually think it is harder to support others during social distancing.  You don't see people, and thus you don't think about them.  People also get wrapped up in their own issues and have no energy left to support others. I wonder what are the cues that spur people to reach out to others.  Visual cues? (when you just look miserable), vocal cues? (when you say you are fine but your tone indicates otherwise), behavioral cues? (when you do things that reveal that you need help), or other things... the things I can think of all require contact of some sort.

I had an interaction with my far-away son this week that revealed to me how much he resented the fact that I may need some additional sensitivity because I am alone during a pandemic. I did not feel supported.  I called several people when this happened, and 3 were helpful.  One was not, but it wasn't her fault.  She was very busy and in fact in the short conversation we had I didn't even bring it up. You always can't count on people to be there for you when you need them -- some of the people some of the time is about as good as it gets."
14,journal-entry-686,"There are several strong mutual aid societies popping up in my neighborhood and closeby and I am very heartened by them. After NYC cancelled city wide food scrap pick up for compost, a group of us claimed a piece of land to compost on and grow some food. The owner of the land is now open to negotiations.

I've been thinking a lot about how Coronavirus is like 9/11. Before, you never had to remove your shoes and could bring any liquid size. Now, TSA always requires you take off your shoes and it can only be 3 oz. for a carry-on. And that's how things are. Similar to COVID-19. You put on a mask and maintain you six-foot distancing. That's how things are. We've adjusted.

I've also been thinking about wearing a mask. Why is it so political? Is it because of the party leaders who have been wearing them? (Or not). Is it because of the reopening of economies in different states? Why are people upset? Is it because they feel like they're being forced?"

Before the pandemic, I was looking for work because we just moved to the state in January. Now, I do not expect to find a job anytime soon nor do I expect to be able to place my daughter in daycare. We have enough money to eat and still buy things we want. I feel guilty because I know so many people are now not able to afford basic needs. 

My mental health, and my husband's as well, has declined. I have experienced intense anxiety and depression that are directly related to the pandemic. I know my husband is also struggling with depression. I started struggling with insomnia in March 2020 and I have tried a variety of prescription sleep aids. To help, I've invested in a few pieces of home exercise equipment and working out about 4 or 5 days a week. Exercise has always been the effective way for me to reduce anxiety and depression. I have also started therapy, which is virtual and one more thing that I am privileged to afford that many others cannot. The overwhelming thoughts that things are not normal, that we cannot go about life like we want to or would normally, sometimes pull me down. There has to be time in the future when we can return to what we did before but I also know that this will become a common occurrence with climate change and I have a hard time thinking about living in a world that looks like this often.

My friends are all middle or upper middle class and have decent relationships with their family, so they have comfortable homes to sleep in and food to eat.

Seeing them run, read newspapers, hold hands strolling, sit i the grass on blankets, take pictures, walk their dogs, play with their children, speed walk. I miss people. Lately, going to this park feels like being part of the world again. Don’t get me wrong, I’m very connected to online spaces like groupchats and social media.

1,journal-entry-778,This week I have been feeling very angry at the south part of the United States... here in NY we were very obedient and worked hard to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  We got it first and worst of anyone else in the country-- it makes me mad that we were able to get it under control while the rest of the United States acted stupid and now their stupidity could affect us again.  I am also really angry with the president Trump.  I HATE HIM SOOOOOOO much.  I blame him and the Republicans for this mess we are in now.  NY could be fully reopening if it wasn't for the rest of the country's stupid denial of science and medicine and refusal to wear masks.  Sometimes I wish NY could separate from the rest of the USA.  If Trump wins again I must move out of this country--  it is going down the drain and it makes me more upset than I can express.  Now we are banned from Europe!?!!! So freaking sad and pathetic.

3,journal-entry-796,"It's been a huge challenge working from home and not having the in-person contact with colleagues and students like I would normally have. We've been doing our best to stay connected online, but it is a challenge, and not the same as in-person. 

It's also been a challenge to learn new technologies.  For example, there are so many different platforms that can be used for working together online - Microsoft Teams, Skype, Webex, Zoom.  It's been a little like drinking from a firehose and trying to figure out how best to use these resources, their limitations, etc.  Which one do you use??  Sometimes, you have a choice, but depending on the group you're working with you have to adjust to a different one.  I've been trying to jump in and just use them, learning haphazardly as I go along.  When possible, I do try to sign up for workshops, or read through/watch materials I find online so I can better understand these resources and how to use them.  I've been using remote desktop to be able to access my work computer from home (so I still have access to our shared drive and other files on my work computer).  However, sometimes the connection doesn't work and I have to go to campus to restart my work computer.  So far, that has worked to resolve the problem, and I know my colleagues have been having the same issue sometimes.  Our team at work will often joke to try the ""good ole restart"" when something isn't working right.  Most of my colleagues are pretty savvy with technology, but for a couple others I know it's been a huge challenge. Also, depending on what kind of internet we have at home, that can also make a big difference.  I think we all try our best to be patient with each other and realize that technology is a great resource, but it's also not perfect and presents it's own set of challenges. "

All my life I never seen this much chaos happen so rapidly and is something that has made me think about my future and those whom I love and how I like most people out there want to progress and have a secure bright future. I stay home although I do take my walks outside and exercise here at home but the deadly shootings that have been happening lately across the boroughs have made me rethink about walking since I don't feel safe to even put some headphones on and jog without having to swivel my head from time to time. I believe that many people living in low income have gone through so much that they have being fed up with so many hatred and despair that it makes them feel like is ""normal"" to do what they do. Some are aware of what they do but the adrenaline and other reasons control their actions and then others aren't aware of it but still commit the wrongful decision since they have nothing to lose living in such poverty that makes them sick and oppressed.

I spent the week in between with belly pain - ultimately diagnosed with an ovarian cyst but I do believe much of the worsening of the pain was due to stress. Then back to the hospital - this time long hours caring for patients who may never leave the hospital. I miss the sense of accomplishment with which I used to leave my job.

Yet I am stuck indoors, waking up around noon, playing video games, and trying to get some work done before the semester begins. The least I can do is not feel tired, to get going. 

The A/C is on all day because it is so hot outside. It makes my head muggy. I can't breathe well and I can't think straight because of the headache. But I think of people who REALLY can't breathe, so I try to suck it up. I try to just do something at home. 

Then again, who am I to care about the US? It is not my country, it is not even my adopted country. I am nothing to the US and so perhaps America should be nothing to me. Even though I spend time educating its students, when it comes down to that, America will abandon me, the foreigner, as soon as it possibly can. Thanks for your contributions we did not ask for.

Anyways there are days when I forget it’s even happening. But then, my grandfathers sister died from COVID and then...bam. It’s suddenly real again.

I haven’t left the house really since mid March. We love on four acres of wooded farm land with chickens and goats. It is the ideal place to hide your family away in a pandemic. To be honest, this is why we moved here... not because of the pandemic but because we wanted to be ready for the shit storm that was sure to happen when climate change hit.  We wanted to build a resilient life and have the resources to be self sufficient should the need arise. We moved here last year, I had no idea it would be this soon.

I have a freedom that won’t happen again - even retired (and I am half a decade from that) I won’t be able to craft my own schedule like this. In many ways I am getting increasingly anxious - I don’t know how I will go back to the way they nags were - except when I am forced into the world I like tha way things are. "
17,journal-entry-252,I'm autistic.  For me this period of time has been the opposite to the experience of many. The restrictions are actually freeing. I'm able to make choices that would otherwise be seen as socially negative. Shopping is less of a challenging experience and I've been able to fully enjoy book club meetings now that they are online.
18,journal-entry-251,There is no huge change for me. I tend to live a pretty isolated life. I have had the opportunity to do more work from home and develop an online service teaching people about mental health. With some clubs going online I've actually had more comfortable contact with other people than usual.
19,journal-entry-257,"Coronavirus has affected everyone in my family to one extent or another. My father's mother passed away in late March (not COVID related), and we were unable to have a funeral for her. That has really negatively affected my grandfather, who is in his early 90s and has to live alone knowing his wife was not properly laid to rest. My dad has been compartmentalizing that, I know. Pushing it away because there's nothing that can be done now. He has also had to start working from home, which he's actually really good at and it keeps him busy. But I know that getting away from the house is good for anyone's moral, and being home all day definitely raises the tensions among us all. My mother's father had an accident while wood-working in his garage and had to have surgery on his hand. We aren't able to go visit with them like we want to because my grandparents are especially strict with the restrictions due to my grandpa's various health ailments. Both my sister and I were laid off from our jobs, my sister's college graduation ceremony got canceled, school for the second semester this year went online completely. My partner decided to move from his apartment back home in Virginia because he has also been working online. He seems to be doing well, and loves to be surrounded by his family when he gets the chance, but as a Black man he is definitely having an increasingly hard time dealing with the emotional labor around the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and now Rayshard Brooks. He's been vocal and participated in protests, and is also concerned about catching coronvirus because he has bad asthma. There are so many people who are having a harder time than I am, and all I can do is be thankful and use the privilege that I have right now to advocate for others that do not have that same kind of privilege and try to make the world a better place for all of us.

20,journal-entry-260,I looooooove quarantine life.  I always hated going to the office and I love the freedom of working at home in my pijamas in my bed with coffee by my side.  Working at my own pace without my boss and colleagues breathing down my neck all day interrupting my thoughts.  I love the freedom of taking a break in the afternoon and going for a walk in the park-- seeing the flowers and the clean blue sky empty of pollution and the quiet of the city which is so new to me now that everyone is locked at home.  I'm sad that we are starting to reopen.  I don't want to lose this feeling of peace and tranquility that I gained during the last few months.

7,journal-entry-80,"Dear Pandemic Journal:

Sadly, I lack much trust in many institutions right now. 

... Abrupt college campus closings forced my kids (like every other college student) to drop everything they were in the middle of working on at school to pack up and leave immediately. My two kids drove cross country together from New England to get back home to Colorado in two days. Families of college students really did not know how to deal with the possibility that their returning kids may be infected and contagious.

As parents, we anxiously collectively waited for each institution to decide how to handle the rest of spring semester 2020. Then, while we all held our breaths during our kids’ travels home, parents discussed the most recent information we had on Covid as well as strategies we could use to keep everyone in the household safe and healthy. These college parent boards provided crucial emotional and informational lifelines for me during March, especially. I trusted and connected with many as similarly concerned parents and am grateful that we were able to be there for each other during a most stressful and uncertain time.

Now, three months later, I honestly do not know who else I can trust  for realistic and reliable information about how the US plans to get through this pandemic in one healthy piece. The re-opening process that has begun is very disorganized and uncoordinated. No central leadership exists. I believe there must be small pockets of health and research experts who really are informed about the status of our situation and what needs to be done. They are kept silent, somehow, or live in fear of political execution, however, and so do not get heard. "
8,journal-entry-63,"Since I'm a political scientist, politics and international relations are often my main focus but any stories about COVID19 are also of interest at the moment and that is how I have stayed on top of virus information as well as political developments. I also look over the main stories in the CNN app and the Daily Mail, the latter just to give me a sense of what a less ""elite"" paper might be focusing on. Although to get a fuller picture I realize I should also check out Fox News, their bias, misinformation and egregious support of Trump is just too much for me. As long as they are simply a propaganda tool for Trump and his cronies, I want nothing to do with them."
9,journal-entry-62,"Do I have COVID19? Who knows?! Thanks Trump administration for making testing impossible unless I’m sick enough to actually be hospitalized. If this is COVID19, I’d also love to know where I contracted it – I tried to self-isolate myself as much as possible last week, when I still thought I had a shot at going to Hawaii, and I took all sorts of precautions when I went out (social distancing, gloves, hand sanitizer, wipes for car surfaces, no face touching)."
10,journal-entry-58,"In my neighborhood I’ve seen a new and pleasant resurgence of the family stroll, jogging or bike ride. I’m wondering where all these people have been before. I guess that the kids are normally in school, after school programs, day care, or organized sports. Parents must normally go to the gym or spa for exercises. I think this family activity aspect of the thing is positive, as is all of the participation of parents in Zoom education.  How can we arrange to keep some of the good aspects of the inconvenience of Covid 19? "
11,journal-entry-53,I am sad and angry of the injustice and blatant racism in America right now. It's mind boggling to me that in the year 2020 we still have to explain what white privilege is. That we still have police brutality. I am angry our government has made the nation divided ten fold than what we used to be. I am angry at our president for everything from his racist tweets to moving peaceful protesters so he can do a  photo op at a church holding a bible. I have been trying to educate myself more on black history and racism as a white woman in America. I will never understand what any POC has to go through on a daily basis but will try with all my heart to be empathetic and educate myself the best I can. 
12,journal-entry-430,"I think the most notable way that COVID affected my life this week is that I've had to wait and reschedule a doctor's examination three times for a coposcopy that has significantly affected my mental health. I've had to wait and worry for over a month to get an appointment, and last week it had to be changed out of the blue because of something out of my control. I'm also worried about going to the doctors because so many people have gotten sick being at the doctors and in hospitals and there is only so much that people can do to contain and stop the spread in those spaces. I worry too that hospital staff are taking the virus less seriously because my state has started to open."
13,journal-entry-288,"Last night I arrived home from Spain, where I'd spent the last four months. ... It's shocking coming back here where people don't wear masks, and seem to be in denial.

14,journal-entry-82,"This is such a tumultuous time in the world. We have a pandemic and have been essentially quarantined for three months. Now there are worldwide protests against police brutality and racism that is creating even greater divides between people. I keep thinking that I need to get off social media, as consuming all the comments from the Facebook groups and seeing people's posts is a roller coaster of emotions.

Some positives from the protests this week:

Racism is declared a public health crisis in Boston

Worldwide protests supporting George Floyd and Black Lives Matter

Confederate flags have been banned from NASCAR, 

A statue of General Lee has been taken down in the south, others to follow"
15,journal-entry-9,"After the brutal murder of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis, the world changed. Protests are worldwide. I think that there is a cosmic plan for the world to change for the better. The pandemic is the catalyst .People are available. People are furious. They have time. They don't have lots of commitments. They are protesting. Their ideas are being challenged. Their values are being challenged. Their racist thoughts are being challenged. A revolution is happening right now.

It is about time."
